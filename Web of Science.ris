TI  - LEADERSHIP IN THE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ERA
T2  - STRATEGICA: PREPARING FOR TOMORROW, TODAY
CP  - 8th International Academic Conference on Strategica - Preparing for Tomorrow, Today
AB  - Technological advances are growing at a very accelerated pace, particularly Artificial Intelligence (AI), which has led to a surge of commercial interest in automation and robotics. "Technology is now at the point of taking us into a magical age," Alphabet (Google) chairman Eric Schmidt quoted in January 2017. Bolstered by the fourth industrial revolution, robotics is used by many industries in order to perform a wide range of tasks, while AI is now able to assist in making complex decisions in an increasing array of applications. The concept of Artificial Intelligence implies the potential for better efficiency and enhanced consistency. Using simulated artificial neurons and algorithms, AI systems are being incrementally adopted by many industries for their improved performance over their human counterparts. However, according to many researchers, the increased use of AI is resulting in a proportionate decrease in human labor while creating gaps at different levels within the organization. Consequently, accommodating this evolutionary transformation and managing the transformational balance between humans and robots, or the huros(1) workforce, has become a mounting challenge on today's leadership. This paper outlines the major challenges that management leaders must face while adopting Artificial Intelligence technology in their organizations. As result of a qualitative research study, we identify critical areas of focus in the transition towards the management in the AI era.

TI  - Psychological reactions to human versus robotic job replacement
T2  - NATURE HUMAN BEHAVIOUR
AB  - Advances in robotics and artificial intelligence are increasingly enabling organizations to replace humans with intelligent machines and algorithms'. Forecasts predict that, in the coming years, these new technologies will affect millions of workers in a wide range of occupations, replacing human workers in numerous tasks(2,3), but potentially also in whole occupations(1,4,5). Despite the intense debate about these developments in economics, sociology and other social sciences, research has not examined how people react to the technological replacement of human labour. We begin to address this gap by examining the psychology of technological replacement. Our investigation reveals that people tend to prefer workers to be replaced by other human workers (versus robots); however, paradoxically, this preference reverses when people consider the prospect of their own job loss. We further demonstrate that this preference reversal occurs because being replaced by machines, robots or software (versus other humans) is associated with reduced self-threat. In contrast, being replaced by robots is associated with a greater perceived threat to one's economic future. These findings suggest that technological replacement of human labour has unique psychological consequences that should be taken into account by policy measures (for example, appropriately tailoring support programmes for the unemployed).

TI  - Service robots in the hospitality industry: The case of Henn-na hotel, Japan
T2  - TECHNOLOGY IN SOCIETY
AB  - Services are changing at an impressive pace boosted by the technological advances felt in Robotics, Big Data, and Artificial Intelligence (AI) that have uncovered new research opportunities. Our objective is to contribute to the literature by exploring the pros and cons of the use of service robots in the hospitality industry and to practice, by presenting the architectural and technological characteristics of a fully automated plant based on a relevant case. To achieve such goal, this article uses a systematic literature review to assess the state-of-the-art, characterize the unit of analysis, and find new avenues for further research. The results indicate that, in high customer contact settings, service robots tend to outperform humans when performing standardized tasks, because of their mechanical and analytical nature. Evidence also shows that, in some cases, service robots have not yet achieved the desired technological maturity to proficiently replace humans. In other words, the technology is not quite there yet, but this does not contradict the fact that new robot technologies, enabled by AI, will be able to replace the employees' empathetic intelligence. In practical terms, organizations are facing challenges where they have to decide whether service robots are capable of completely replacing human labor or if they should rather invest in balanced options, such as human-robot systems, that seem to be a much more rational choice today.

TI  - AI, RPA, ML and Other Emerging Technologies: Anticipating Adoption in the HRM Field
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE EUROPEAN CONFERENCE ON THE IMPACT OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND ROBOTICS (ECIAIR 2019)
CP  - European Conference on the Impact of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics (ECIAIR)
AB  - Emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, robotic process automation and machine learning bring a profound change to the way organisations operate. The study by Frey and Osborne (2013) studied the likelihood of some 700 individual occupations being 'lost' to computers and robots. They found that 47% of the studied jobs were at risk of obsolescence. The phenomenon is not new - many jobs have disappeared and human labour has diminished (MGI 2011; Breshanan, 1999). This development makes the human resource management (HRM) function a nerve centre that facilitates the transformation to this new world of work. Frey and Osborne see the role of human resource managers as being in the top fifth percentile in terms of its likelihood to continue to exist. However, HRM needs to understand the emerging technologies to 1) understand what they mean for jobs across different departments, and 2) understand how HRM jobs and processes themselves will be impacted by the intrusion of these emerging technologies. This study sheds light on views held by the HRM community on the impact of novel technologies. The results indicate that the main drivers of tech intrusion to HRM are related to processing speed and reduced costs. The main obstacles are the uncertainty over the choice of technology and the cost of implementation. Different technologies have varying potential when screened against individual HR functions. The individual emerging technologies also have a varying lead time to their wide usage by HR across companies.

TI  - Enterprise AI Canvas Integrating Artificial Intelligence into Business
T2  - APPLIED ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
AB  - Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning have enormous potential to transform businesses and disrupt entire industry sectors. However, companies wishing to integrate algorithmic decisions into their organization face multiple challenges: They have to identify use-cases in which artificial intelligence can create value, as well as decisions that can be supported or executed automatically. Furthermore, the organization will need to be transformed to be able to integrate AI-based systems into their human work-force. In addition, the more technical aspects of the underlying machine learning model have to be discussed in terms of how they impact the various units of a business: Where do the relevant data come from, which constraints have to be considered, how is the quality of the data and the prediction evaluated? The Enterprise AI canvas is designed to bring data scientist and business expert together to discuss and define all relevant aspects which need to be clarified in order to integrate AI-based systems into a digital enterprise. It consists of two parts, where part one focuses on the business view and organizational aspects, whereas part two focuses on the underlying machine learning model and the data it uses.

TI  - The Ethical Dimensions of Public Opinion on Smart Robots
T2  - TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION MANAGEMENT REVIEW
AB  - This article investigates public opinion about smart robots, with special focus on the ethical dimension. In so doing, the study reviews relevant literature and analyzes data from the comments sections of four publically available online news articles on smart robots. Findings from the content analysis of investigated comments suggest that public opinion about smart robots remains fairly negative, and that public discussion is focused on potentially negative social and economic impacts of smart robots on society, as well as various liability issues. In particular, many comments were what can only be called "apocalyptical", suggesting that the rise of smart robots is a threat to the very existence of human beings, and that the replacement of human labour by smart robots will lead to deepening the socio-economic gap, and concentrating power and wealth in the hands of even fewer people. Further, public discussion seems to pay little attention to the debate on whether robots should have "rights", or on the increasing environmental effects of the growth in robotics. This study contributes to the extant literature on "roboethics", by suggesting a dendrogram approach to illustrate themes based on a qualitative content analysis. It suggests that smart robot manufacturers should ensure better transparency and inclusion in their robotics design processes to foster public adoption of robots.

TI  - Perpetual growth, the labor share, and robots
T2  - ECONOMICS OF INNOVATION AND NEW TECHNOLOGY
AB  - The recent literature on the economic effects of machine learning, robotization and artificial intelligence suggests that there may be an upcoming wave of substitution of human labor by machines. We argue that these new technologies may lead to so-called perpetual growth, i.e. growth of per capita income with a non-progressing state of technology. We specify an exact parameter threshold beyond which perpetual growth emerges, and argue that ongoing technological change may bring the threshold in reach. We also show that in a state of perpetual growth, factor-eliminating technological progress reduces the role of labor in the production process and that this leads to a rising wage rate but ever-declining share of wage income. We present simulation experiments on several policy options to combat this inequality, including a universal basic income as well as an option in which workers become owners of 'robots'.

AB  - Disasters are increased in number. No matter what the cause of the disaster is human or natural, the consequence is always hard and takes long time to deal with if only human labor is used. Robotic systems are used more and more in search and rescue mission to shorten the time as well as reduce the danger for human. Mobile robot system faced difficulties of uncertainties in sensor system, unstructured environments, or lack adaptive ability to situation and dynamic environments. This paper proposed a system utilized mobile robot with aid from aerial imaging system to assist its intelligent control system. System is autonomous control to process the environment for search and rescue mission. The joint operation achieved the detection and avoidance of obstacles with different features to guide ground robot to target.

T2  - IEEE 21ST INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ADVANCED LEARNING TECHNOLOGIES (ICALT 2021)
CP  - 21st IEEE International Conference on Advanced Learning Technologies (ICALT)
AB  - The use of computer-mediated communication (CMC) has been ubiquitous in higher education. To better understand students' behaviors and facilitate students' learning through CMC, this study aimed to classify messages in Facebook learning group which was created as an on-line discussion board. Different machine learning and deep learning classification models were proposed, trained and testified with corpuses from PTT, one of the famous on-line forums in Taiwan. Furthermore, the classification of Facebook messages by these well-trained models were compared with human coding. Results revealed that recurrent neural network (RNN) with word to vector (W2V) for feature extraction demonstrated the best performance in accuracy. In addition, the combination of RNN and TF-IDF was proved to have the highest correlation with human work. Implications for artificial intelligence (AI) in education context was discussed.

TI  - Should we fear the robot revolution? (The correct answer is yes)
T2  - JOURNAL OF MONETARY ECONOMICS
AB  - Advances in artificial intelligence and robotics may be leading to a new industrial revolution. This paper presents a model with the minimum necessary features to analyze the implications for inequality and output. Two assumptions are key: "robot" capital is distinct from traditional capital in its degree of substitutability with human labor; and only capitalists and skilled workers save. We analyze a range of variants that reflect widely different views of how automation may transform the labor market. Our main results are surprisingly robust: automation is good for growth and bad for equality; in the benchmark model real wages fall in the short run and eventually rise, but "eventually" can easily take generations.

TI  - Imitation Learning System Design with Small Training Data for Flexible Tool Manipulation
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AUTOMATION TECHNOLOGY
AB  - Population aging has become a major problem in developed countries. As the labor force declines, robot arms are expected to replace human labor for simple tasks. A robotic arm attaches a tool specialized for a task and acquires the movement through teaching by an engineer with expert knowledge. However, the number of such engineers is limited; therefore, a teaching method that can be used by non-technical personnel is necessitated. As a teaching method, deep learning can be used to imitate human behavior and tool usage. However, deep learning requires a large amount of training data for learning. In this study, the target task of the robot is to sweep multiple pieces of dirt using a broom. The proposed learning system can estimate the initial parameters for deep learning based on experience, as well as the shape and physical properties of the tools. It can reduce the number of training data points when learning a new tool. A virtual reality system is used to move the robot arm easily and safely, as well as to create training data for imitation. In this study, cleaning experiments are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The experimental results confirm that the proposed method can accelerate the learning speed of deep learning and acquire cleaning ability using a small amount of training data.

TI  - Exploring the impact of artificial Intelligence: Prediction versus judgment
T2  - INFORMATION ECONOMICS AND POLICY
AB  - Based on recent developments in the field of artificial intelligence (AI), we examine what type of human labor will be a substitute versus a complement to emerging technologies. We argue that these recent developments reduce the costs of providing a particular set of tasks - prediction tasks. Prediction about uncertain states of the world is an input into decision-making. We show that prediction allows riskier decisions to be taken and this is its impact on observed productivity although it could also increase the variance of outcomes as well. We consider the role of human judgment in decision-making as prediction technology improves. judgment is exercised when the objective function for a particular set of decisions cannot be described (i.e., coded). However, we demonstrate that better prediction impacts the returns to different types of judgment in opposite ways. Hence, not all human judgment will be a complement to AI. Finally, we show that humans will delegate some decisions to machines even when the decision would be superior with human input. Crown Copyright (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Within digital transformation, which is continuously progressing, robotic process automation (RPA) is drawing much corporate attention. While RPA is a popular topic in the corporate world, the academic research lacks a theoretical and synoptic analysis of RPA. Conducting a literature review and tool analysis, we propose - in a holistic and structured way - four traits that characterize RPA, providing orientation as well as a focus for further research. Software robots automate processes originally performed by human work. Thus, software robots follow a choreography of technological modules and control flow operators while operating within IT ecosystems and using established applications. Ease-of-use and adaptability allow companies to conceive and implement software robots through (agile) projects. Organizational and IT strategy, governance structures, and management systems therefore must address both the direct effects of software robots automating processes and their indirect impacts on firms.

T2  - 2017 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING AND ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT (IEEM)
CP  - IEEE International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Engineering Management (IEEE IEEM)
AB  - Recent improvement in robotics has sharply increased the adoption rate of robotic systems as robots are now more cost-effective when compared to human labor and a lot easier to use. Consequently, more people with little or no experience of line design are overseeing line automation. This paper proposes an easy-to-use tool with an application in a car-body shop -extension for application to other processes is feasible with minor modifications. In car-body shops, most of the operations are performed by robots that load and weld stamped steel parts. These robots are organized in cells separated by buffers. One of the main objectives of car-body shop designers is to keep cost as low as possible with no impact on the production rate and the quality of the parts produced. To do that, they have at their disposal two main levers: the size of buffers and the number of robots. Adding more buffers could reduce the impact of disruptions and, consequently, increase the production rate. On the other hand, adding robots will speed up the lines which would also increase the production rate. Both add significant but different costs. Also, additional robots means additional failures, and this may reduce or reverse the increase in production rate. Given a target production rate, the goal of the method submitted in this paper is to help production line designers answer the following questions: What robot and buffer space allocation will meet the target at least cost? This paper proposes a judicious analytic solution based on simplifying yet realistic assumptions.

TI  - Robotization and labour dislocation in the manufacturing sectors of OECD countries: a panel VAR approach
T2  - APPLIED ECONOMICS
AB  - Robots are the most important innovation which has affected the production process in the last three decades. Thanks to the latest advances in technology, they have been able to perform an ever-increasing number of tasks, eventually replacing human work within the whole production process. However, because of the scarcity of suitable data, the extent of this potentially disrupting process is not fully assessed. This paper makes up for the lack of empirical evidence on the effect of robotization on labour dislocation using data collected by the International Federation of Robotics (IFR) on the number of robots installed in the different manufacturing industries of 16 OECD countries over the period 2011-2016. We show that at the industry level a 1% growth in the number of robots reduces the growth rate of worked hours by 0.16, as well as the selling prices and the real values of the compensations of employees. Moreover, we show that a given sector is more likely to be robotized when it is expanding both in terms of relative prices and employee compensations. We conclude that, at least in the selected countries, the introduction of robots plays a key role in slowing down human labour and compensation growth.

AB  - Focusing on the self-accumulation ability and the nonrival characteristic of artificial intelligence (AI), this paper develops a three-sector endogenous growth model and investigates the impact of the development of AI along the transitional dynamics path and the balanced growth path. The development of AI can increase economic growth along the transitional dynamics path, and can increase household short-run utility if an increase in the accumulation of AI is due to the rising productivity in the goods or AI sector, but can be detrimental to household short-run utility if an increase in the accumulation of AI is because firms use more AI to replace human labor. In addition, the development of AI is not necessarily beneficial to household welfare in the long run. The main results are unaffected when considering the case where AI can improve the accumulation of human capital, the traditional research and development model, and different kinds of physical capital.

CP  - IEEE International Conference on Smart Technologies and Management for Computing, Communication, Controls, Energy and Materials (ICSTM)
AB  - In many countries, robots and automation techniques are being introduced in agriculture farms to reduce the human labour and to improve the yield. However, such technological initiatives are still lacking in India, although it is the leading producer of many vegetables and fruits, for example, coconuts. Some of the activities carried out in a coconut farm that requires human labor are coconut dehusking, loading and unloading of coconuts. Automating these activities in a coconut farm would require a robotic system to pick and transport coconuts, for which the primary need would be to detect coconuts in those environments under natural lighting conditions. Towards this, the work in this paper tests for the applicability of three most used computer vision based object detection approaches namely, Local Binary Pattern (LBP) cascade, Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) cascade and Haar - like cascade in coconut detection. This vision system would enable any field robot to automate the tasks in coconut farms without human assistance. A comparative analysis using confusion matrix is carried on these three approaches. It is observed that Haar-like features provided comparably better results among all the three features, in terms of hit rate and precision.

T2  - RESEARCH & INNOVATION FORUM 2019: TECHNOLOGY, INNOVATION, EDUCATION, AND THEIR SOCIAL IMPACT
CP  - Research and Innovation Forum (Rii Forum)
AB  - The emerging technologies based on artificial intelligence and robotics are challenging the landscape for human labor. Revolution 4.0 is progressively questioning some business models, changing the balance between creation and destruction of jobs, accelerating the transformation of occupational and skills requirements and affecting the distribution of income, because these technologies can replace both manual and cognitive skills. Our research analyzes how digital revolution is affecting labor market in Spain. We mainly focus on the new employment created since the outbreak of the recent financial crisis. We confirm a skill-biased technological change, although the new occupations are mostly demanding a limited set of complex skills. This is a consequence of the routine task-intensive economic structure in Spain. Although digital technologies are inciting a task-biased technological change, decreasing the demand for workers performing routine tasks, this is not the case in Spain. The predominance of routine (but not repetitive) tasks in many services linked to serving, attending, health and care is limiting the scope of automation. The immediate consequence is a growing polarization in employment opportunities and incomes. In addition, a progressive de-skilling effect is emerging, with high-skilled workers moving down the occupational ladder, whereas the wage premium is declining.

TI  - Robots Under COVID-19 Pandemic: A Comprehensive Survey
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
AB  - As a result of the difficulties brought by COVID-19 and its associated lockdowns, many individuals and companies have turned to robots in order to overcome the challenges of the pandemic. Compared with traditional human labor, robotic and autonomous systems have advantages such as an intrinsic immunity to the virus and an inability for human-robot-human spread of any disease-causing pathogens, though there are still many technical hurdles for the robotics industry to overcome. This survey comprehensively reviews over 200 reports covering robotic systems which have emerged or have been repurposed during the past several months, to provide insights to both academia and industry. In each chapter, we cover both the advantages and the challenges for each robot, finding that robotics systems are overall apt solutions for dealing with many of the problems brought on by COVID-19, including: diagnosis, screening, disinfection, surgery, telehealth, care, logistics, manufacturing and broader interpersonal problems unique to the lockdowns of the pandemic. By discussing the potential new robot capabilities and fields they applied to, we expect the robotics industry to take a leap forward due to this unexpected pandemic.

TI  - An E-Commerce Customer Service Robot Based on Intention Recognition Model
T2  - JOURNAL OF ELECTRONIC COMMERCE IN ORGANIZATIONS
AB  - There are three defects for providing human-labor customer services in e-commerce operations: high costs of human labors, staff turnover, and lack of service quality assurance. Breakthroughs made in artificial intelligence, natural language processing and related fields make it possible to replace human labors with online artificial intelligent robots to provide the e-commerce customer service, which indicates the online robots are the future of e-commerce customer services. However, most of the current robots are designed to reply with knowledge matching the key words in question sentences from the database, rarely involving in research on customer intentions that are key factors influencing user experience and online sales. In this research, an intention recognizing model was proposed to obtain intentions of e-commerce consumers by computing the strengths of candidate intention nodes in the intention graph, which was used to describe relations between different goods that could be the intentional targets of e-commerce consumers. The proposed robot was constructed based on the intention recognizing model to identify intentions of consumers and use the located knowledge combined with the AIML based sentence composition template to produce the response sentences for consumers. At last, the proposed robot was evaluated using F3 and ROUGE metrics by comparing with a keyword matching robot. And the evaluation results proved the validity of the proposed robot.

TI  - Sensor Based Motion Planning and Estimation of High-rise Building Facade Maintenance Robot
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRECISION ENGINEERING AND MANUFACTURING
AB  - With the increasing number of high-rise and large-scale buildings, modern buildings are becoming intelligent, and are incurring high construction costs and requiring careful maintenance. Maintenance works for high-rise buildings significantly depend on human labor, unlike other construction processes that are gradually being automated The resulting accidents may produce very high social and economic losses. To address this problem, herein, this paper proposes robotic building maintenance system using multi-robot concept, in specific, cleaning a building facade which is directly subjected to minimize human labor: that improves the process efficiency and economic feasibility The sensor for detecting contamination of building's outer-wall glass is proposed; Kalman filter was used for estimating robots' status with the contamination of the window glass. Task allocation of the sensor based multi-robots for an effective way of task execution is introduced and the feasibility was verified through the simulations.

TI  - Wall-Following Behavior for a Disinfection Robot Using Type 1 and Type 2 Fuzzy Logic Systems
T2  - SENSORS
AB  - Infectious diseases are caused by pathogenic microorganisms, whose transmission can lead to global pandemics like COVID-19. Contact with contaminated surfaces or objects is one of the major channels of spreading infectious diseases among the community. Therefore, the typical contaminable surfaces, such as walls and handrails, should often be cleaned using disinfectants. Nevertheless, safety and efficiency are the major concerns of the utilization of human labor in this process. Thereby, attention has drifted toward developing robotic solutions for the disinfection of contaminable surfaces. A robot intended for disinfecting walls should be capable of following the wall concerned, while maintaining a given distance, to be effective. The ability to operate in an unknown environment while coping with uncertainties is crucial for a wall disinfection robot intended for deployment in public spaces. Therefore, this paper contributes to the state-of-the-art by proposing a novel method of establishing the wall-following behavior for a wall disinfection robot using fuzzy logic. A non-singleton Type 1 Fuzzy Logic System (T1-FLS) and a non-singleton Interval Type 2 Fuzzy Logic System (IT2-FLS) are developed in this regard. The wall-following behavior of the two fuzzy systems was evaluated through simulations by considering heterogeneous wall arrangements. The simulation results validate the real-world applicability of the proposed FLSs for establishing the wall-following behavior for a wall disinfection robot. Furthermore, the statistical outcomes show that the IT2-FLS has significantly superior performance than the T1-FLS in this application.

TI  - Preference for human (vs. robotic) labor is stronger in symbolic consumption contexts
T2  - JOURNAL OF CONSUMER PSYCHOLOGY
AB  - Advances in robotics, automation, and artificial intelligence increasingly enable firms to replace human labor with technology, thereby fundamentally transforming how goods and services are produced. From both managerial and societal points of view, it is therefore important to understand demand-side incentives for firms to employ human labor. We begin to address this question by examining for which products and services consumers are more likely to favor human (vs. robotic) labor. In six studies, we demonstrate that consumers prefer human (vs. robotic) labor more for products with higher (vs. lower) symbolic value (e.g., when expressing something about one's beliefs and personality is of greater importance). We theorize that this is because consumers have stronger uniqueness motives in more (vs. less) symbolic consumption contexts (and associate human labor more strongly with product uniqueness). In line with this account, we demonstrate that individual differences in need for uniqueness moderate the interaction between production mode and symbolic motives and that a measure of uniqueness motives mediates the effect of consumption context on preferences for human (vs. robotic) production.

AB  - Nursing homes and long-term care institutions often need technological assistance because of the high ratio of low functioning residents coupled with a shortage of caregivers. To explore the potential uses of emerging robotic technologies in nursing homes, we apply Forlizzi's concept of the product ecology and a user-centered design approach involving field study and focus groups to understand what kind of robot design would be suitable in the nursing home context. Our preliminary results show that instead of a robot which completely replaces human labor, nursing home staff prefer robot assistants who fit into their working process. We also learned the most appropriate functions for robots in nursing homes were helping with minor tasks and encouraging social interaction among residents.

T2  - 2019 IEEE 15TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INTELLIGENT COMPUTER COMMUNICATION AND PROCESSING (ICCP 2019)
CP  - IEEE 15th International Conference on Intelligent Computer Communication and Processing (ICCP)
AB  - Modernization of living environments and human activities have severe effects on many parameters and factors such as climate change and global warming, an increase of incidence and the severity of wildfires, land surfaces and ice sheets, ecological imbalance, change of fertility of the soil, flow of energy, food security, etc. In addition, human modernization has had a negative impact on biodiversity and the natural environment. An integral component of modernization is agriculture that associates with the outdoor environment and relevant issues. Automation of agricultural activities contributes to reducing the dependency on human labor and the harmful effects on the natural environment. The correct identification of plants in outdoor environments has been neglected and many critical environmental and non-environmental limits and factors, such as weather conditions, time, viewpoint, lighting conditions (illuminations and light intensity), distance, etc., have not been considered in existing plant recognition systems and technologies. Hence, there is a demand to develop mobile and real-time systems for plant recognition in natural environments. This paper addresses these challenges and introduces the application of autonomous mobile robot and semi-robots for recognition of natural plant species in outdoor environments. Furthermore, the proposed system presents the use of employing low-cost cameras, such as iPhone 6s, Canon EOS 6001) and Samsung Galaxy Note 4, for plant recognition system in real-time. The performance of the system has been tested with a number of experiments in different years, 2017 and 2018, and at different times of day, morning and evening. The proposed system is a combination of new technologies involving deep learning concepts and an autonomous field robot to carry out precise plant recognition in challenging environments. The final accuracy of the mobile real-time system is 84.1666%.

TI  - A New Keynesian Model with Robots: Implications for Business Cycles and Monetary Policy
T2  - ATLANTIC ECONOMIC JOURNAL
AB  - This paper examines the effects of labor-replacing capital, referred to as robots, on business cycle dynamics using a New Keynesian model with a role for both traditional and robot capital. This study finds that shocks to the price of robots have effects on wages, output, and employment that are distinct from shocks to the price of traditional capital. Further, the inclusion of robots alters the response of employment and labor's share to total factor productivity and monetary policy shocks. The presence of robots also weakens the correlation between human labor and output and the correlation between human labor and labor's share. The paper finds that monetary policymakers would need to place a greater emphasis on output stabilization if their objective is to minimize a weighted average of output and inflation volatility. Moreover, if policymakers have an employment stabilization objective apart from their output stabilization objective, they would have to further focus on output stabilization due to the deterioration of the output-employment correlation.

T2  - EDUCATION EXCELLENCE AND INNOVATION MANAGEMENT: A 2025 VISION TO SUSTAIN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT DURING GLOBAL CHALLENGES
CP  - 35th International-Business-Information-Management-Association Conference (IBIMA)
AB  - The issues of business process automation and robotic process automation are usually associated with using physical solutions in production processes. These solutions enable performing activities independently of human participation. Such an approach limits the possibility of applying automation and robotization mainly to manufacturing and the IT processes which are performed as predefined in software used by organizations. A separate category of IT solutions is the technology of automation of repetitive business processes by means of computer programs - robots emulating human work the so-called Robotic Process Automation or RPA. The aim of this paper is the assessment of the usefulness of application of software robots cooperating in business process optimization. For the purpose of this paper, capabilities of software robots were determined, an implementation was carried out and 3 scenarios of robot work were developed. On the basis of the analysis of implementation works and effects of robot work during the studied period, possibilities and potential applications of solutions automating (supporting) business IT processes in public and commercial institutions in Poland were determined.

TI  - Expectations of artificial intelligence and the performativity of ethics: Implications for communication governance
T2  - BIG DATA & SOCIETY
AB  - This article draws on the sociology of expectations to examine the construction of expectations of 'ethical AI' and considers the implications of these expectations for communication governance. We first analyse a range of public documents to identify the key actors, mechanisms and issues which structure societal expectations around artificial intelligence (AI) and an emerging discourse on ethics. We then explore expectations of AI and ethics through a survey of members of the public. Finally, we discuss the implications of our findings for the role of AI in communication governance. We find that, despite societal expectations that we can design ethical AI, and public expectations that developers and governments should share responsibility for the outcomes of AI use, there is a significant divergence between these expectations and the ways in which AI technologies are currently used and governed in large scale communication systems. We conclude that discourses of 'ethical AI' are generically performative, but to become more effective we need to acknowledge the limitations of contemporary AI and the requirement for extensive human labour to meet the challenges of communication governance. An effective ethics of AI requires domain appropriate AI tools, updated professional practices, dignified places of work and robust regulatory and accountability frameworks.

TI  - An Intelligent Robotic Transformer Insertion System
T2  - 2016 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SYSTEM SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING (ICSSE)
CP  - IEEE International Conference on System Science and Engineering (ICSSE)
AB  - Inserting electronic components is a commonly-seen step in a manufacturing process of electronic products. Previously it was done by human operators. As long as the shortage of human labor advents, the insertion process of electronic components has been replaced by robots. Because pins of electronic components are usually curved and tilted from piece to piece, it becomes difficult to insert them onto electrical boards by robots. Thus, this paper presents an intelligent insertion system that uses the Fuzzy c-means (FCM) and the hierarchical support vector machines (SVM) to find an appropriate robotic insertion position and orientation by images of transformer pins. The experiments validated the proposed method using a 6-DOF robot arm. The result showed that the accuracy rate of the hierarchical SVMs on five hundred testing transformers is up to 90%.

T2  - PROBLEMY ZARZADZANIA-MANAGEMENT ISSUES
AB  - Currently, one of the major trends of digital transformation is business process automation, and, in particular, robotic process automation - i.e. replacing human work with software robots. In such context, the term Robotic Process Automation (RPA) may be viewed in two different ways - narrow and broad. In the narrow view, RPA is a fast growing class of software for developing software robots. In the broader view, it is a particular type of an organizational and technological change (the inherent part of which is the specific software implementation), leading to the emergence of a hybrid work environment within which humans and robots collaborate with each other. This is such a new field that a commonly accepted conceptual apparatus (terminology) has not been developed yet; also methodical tools for effective robotic process automation management are missing. Based on the above observations, it was deemed justified to conduct research aimed at: (G1): identifying the differentiators of robotic process automation and the key stages of its implementation, (G2): defining the "capability maps" concept and outlining the principles for designing capability maps; (G3): developing an initial version of the reference robotic capability map and completing its pilot verification.
   A set of the following research tools was used for this purpose: literature analysis method, semi-structured interviews, creative thinking techniques, case study analysis. The outcome of the research conducted is the development of a proprietary, initial version of the reference robotic capability map that was verified at one of companies operating in Poland. This tool enables obtaining a complete view of the current and required capabilities of an organization to conduct an effective robotic process automation.

AB  - The robotic arm is a robot that is used in the manufacturing industry. It has been used as a substitute for human labor in continuous work on 24 hours a day, tasks that need to be repeated all the time, dangerous jobs, and hard work that humans cannot do. Usually, humans can do everything; however, they are not able to work continuously for a long time because humans get tired and so they need to rest. This paper proposes a development of base of robot arm using Finite Element Analysis method to analyze and evaluate of the material of new base of robot arm. The influential factors affecting the parts of base of robot arm are studied and analyzed. The results of the plastic PA GF30 show that can be used to replace the cast iron base, the plastic material will reduce the overall cost material by 15 %. and the weight reduce from cast iron by 80 %

T2  - JOURNAL OF SERVICE RESEARCH
AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly reshaping service by performing various tasks, constituting a major source of innovation, yet threatening human jobs. We develop a theory of AI job replacement to address this double-edged impact. The theory specifies four intelligences required for service tasks-mechanical, analytical, intuitive, and empathetic-and lays out the way firms should decide between humans and machines for accomplishing those tasks. AI is developing in a predictable order, with mechanical mostly preceding analytical, analytical mostly preceding intuitive, and intuitive mostly preceding empathetic intelligence. The theory asserts that AI job replacement occurs fundamentally at the task level, rather than the job level, and for "lower" (easier for AI) intelligence tasks first. AI first replaces some of a service job's tasks, a transition stage seen as augmentation, and then progresses to replace human labor entirely when it has the ability to take over all of a job's tasks. The progression of AI task replacement from lower to higher intelligences results in predictable shifts over time in the relative importance of the intelligences for service employees. An important implication from our theory is that analytical skills will become less important, as AI takes over more analytical tasks, giving the "softer" intuitive and empathetic skills even more importance for service employees. Eventually, AI will be capable of performing even the intuitive and empathetic tasks, which enables innovative ways of human-machine integration for providing service but also results in a fundamental threat for human employment.

CP  - 14th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Soft Computing (ICAISC)
AB  - Rice is an important crop utilized as a staple food in many parts of the world and particularly of importance in Asia. The process to grow rice is very human labor intensive. Much of the difficult labor of rice production can be automated with intelligent and robotic platforms. We propose an intelligent agent which can use sensors to automate the process of distinguishing between rice and weeds, so that a robot can cultivate fields. This paper describes a feature-based learning approach to automatically identify and distinguish weeds from rice plants. A Harris Corner Detection algorithm is firstly applied to find the points of interests such as the tips of leaf and the rice ear, secondly, multiple features for each points surrounding area are extracted to feed into a machine learning algorithm to discriminate weed from rice, last but not least, a clustering algorithm is used for noise removal based on the points position and density. Evaluation performed on images downloaded from internet yielded very promising classification result.

TI  - Human Cognition in Interaction With Robots: Taking the Robot's Perspective Into Account
T2  - HUMAN FACTORS
AB  - Objective The present study investigated whether and how different human-robot interactions in a physically shared workspace influenced human stimulus-response (SR) relationships. Background Human work is increasingly performed in interaction with advanced robots. Since human-robot interaction often takes place in physical proximity, it is crucial to investigate the effects of the robot on human cognition. Method In two experiments, we compared conditions in which humans interacted with a robot that they either remotely controlled or monitored under otherwise comparable conditions in the same shared workspace. The cognitive extent to which the participants took the robot's perspective served as a dependent variable and was evaluated with a SR compatibility task. Results The results showed pronounced compatibility effects from the robot's perspective when participants had to take the perspective of the robot during the task, but significantly reduced compatibility effects when human and robot did not interact. In both experiments, compatibility effects from the robot's perspective resulted in statistically significant differences in response times and in error rates between compatible and incompatible conditions. Conclusion We concluded that SR relationships from the perspective of the robot need to be considered when designing shared workspaces that require users to take the perspective of the robot. Application The results indicate changed compatibility relationships when users share their workplace with an interacting robot and therefore have to take its perspective from time to time. The perspective-dependent processing times are expected to be accompanied by corresponding error rates, which might affect-for instance-safety and efficiency in a production process.

AB  - This paper proposes a system that uses visual servos in service robots to improve the accuracy of disposal work in retail stores. In recent years, service robots that can support human work have become expected. In particular, it would he useful to apply a robot system that includes a service robot system to daily work such as retail display and disposal tasks. However, there are several problems; one is that the positioning accuracy of object manipulation can be low because of mechanical stiffness. To address this problem, we employ a technology called visual servoing, which has been widely applied in the arms of industrial and other types of robots, to the control of double-armed service robots. Our developed robot system is constructed using a robotics middleware platform, because of its software reusability. The experimental results confirm the effectiveness of developed system for stable disposal operations.

T2  - 2019 IEEE/RSJ INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INTELLIGENT ROBOTS AND SYSTEMS (IROS)
CP  - IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)
AB  - Cleaning requirements of glass facades of high-rise buildings have been significantly increased in recent years due to the growth of the construction industry. The conventional cleaning methods for high-rise buildings require human labor where efficiency, cost, and safety are major concerns. Therefore, robotic systems that can climb and clean glass facades in high-rise buildings have been developed. Capability to attach to a facade surface is one of the critical requirements of a glass facade cleaning robot. Diverse approaches have been proposed for adhesion of cleaning robots to a glass facade. Active vacuum suction mechanisms are widely used for these robots since they provide better controllability to move the robots smartly on the surface. Notably, those are decent for a reconfigurable robot that can transit between window frames. The suction mechanism of a glass facade cleaning robot must provide a reliable suction force to make the robot stay safely and move smartly on a facade. Nevertheless, these suction mechanisms can be failed due to improper fastening between a facade and the mechanism, which may lead to safety and operational issues. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel method to realize the adhesion-awareness of a glass facade cleaning robot. The adhesion-awareness is realized by analyzing The current drawn by the motors attached to the impellers of the vacuum mechanisms. Experiment results validate the capability of the proposed approach in raising the adhesion-awareness of a facade cleaning robot.

AB  - Advances in robotics promote interest in applications in the poultry industry to reduce human labor; however, skeptics express concerns regarding potential animal stress stemming from poultry-robot interactions. The objective of this study was to evaluate the avoidance distance (AD), a parameter reflecting stress in an animal due to an approaching object, of broilers and laying hens to a human assessor and a robotic ground vehicle. ADs were determined for birds at different ages ( 2, 4, 6, and 8 week old broilers; 28, 47, and 66 week old brown hens; and 27, 46, and 70 week old white hens) in a commercial broiler house and two commercial cage-free hen houses. The poultry-robot ADs were determined at three robot operating speeds (0.2, 0.4, and 0.6 m s(-1)) and two operation frequencies (bi-weekly and daily, for broilers only). The results show that the overall poultry-human and poultry-robot ADs were, respectively, 48 to 82 cm and 83 to 110 cm for broilers, 54 to 87 cm and 114 to 131 cm for brown hens, and 71 to 76 cm and 92 to 99 cm for white hens when the birds experienced the robot on test days only. Broiler-robot ADs significantly decreased to 30 to 63 cm when the birds were exposed to the robot daily, reflecting less stress induced by the robot than by the human. Poultry ADs to the human and robot tended to decrease for older birds. Slower robot operating speeds led to shorter ADs for broilers at 6 and 8 weeks of age and for white hens at all ages but did not affect ADs for broilers at 2 and 4 weeks of age and brown hens at all ages. Slower robot operating speeds also reduced the bird fleeing speed (FS). It is concluded that the robot did not induce more stress than the human in the broilers. The baseline poultry-robot ADs obtained in this study provide valuable information for understanding poultry interactions with robots and may help optimize robot operations for application in the poultry industry.

TI  - Balancing human-and-robot integration in building tasks
T2  - COMPUTER-AIDED CIVIL AND INFRASTRUCTURE ENGINEERING
AB  - In the last two decades, a wide range of robotic systems for interior construction tasks was being examined (mainly by research and development institutions around the world). A main parameter that differentiates between these systems is their level of autonomy. Reducing the level of autonomy of a given robotic system necessitates increasing auxiliary human work. The efficiency of the system as a whole (i.e., robot/s + operator/s + worker/s) must be examined in order to determine the proper balance between robots and human beings. This article presents the development of a methodology for evaluating a robotized construction task by examining and comparing various ways to share the work between robots and human operators and workers. The methodology is demonstrated by implementing it on two interior finishing tasks-block laying and wall painting. Testing these tasks included full-scale experiments. The detailed analyses of these two applications show the breakeven points of profitable robotic systems, depending on the combination of their own cost, the hourly cost of construction workers, and the expected hourly cost of construction-robot operators in a given labor market. The results lead to a better understanding of possible human-and-robot integration. In particular, this article provides researchers and developers of construction robotics with a systematic approach for evaluation and validation of various ideas prior to investing resources in actual prototypes.

CP  - 3rd International Conference on Frontiers in Automobile and Mechanical Engineering (FAME)
AB  - Pipelines deteriorate gradually over a period of time due to various factors. The limitation in these pipeline systems is that they are affected by various factors such as environmental conditions, corrosion, cracks etc. Maintenance and repair of these systems are labor-intensive and expensive. This can be solved by designing a pipeline inspection robot that would reduce human labor. Such robots will also be helpful in pipeline inspection in hazardous and in accessible environments. This paper aims to review the different types of pipeline robots based on various characteristics such as accuracy in inspection, size and adaptability to shape, flexibility, vertical mobility, scalability, cost, speed, design complexity, impact on the pipe and motion efficiency. Based on the literature survey, a design is proposed.

T2  - 2014 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INFORMATION AND AUTOMATION (ICIA)
CP  - IEEE International Conference on Information and Automation (ICIA)
AB  - With the maturity of the industrial robotic technology, robotic cells are gradually regarded as a kind of stand equipment to replace human work in every walk of life. How to obtain the maximum or approximate maximum throughput in a robotic cell is always the highlighted goal, especially in the rapid growing 3C industry market. In this paper, the objective is to get a 1-unit cycle sequence of robot actions that approximately minimizes the cycle time to produce a part and maximizes the throughput by using a new hybrid algorithm in the robotic cell with a dual-gripper robot. In this algorithm, different constrains are considered during computing the cycle time, including free/non-free process, allowed time window. The resulting diagrams provide very intuitive insights into the accuracy of the hybrid algorithm compared with the exact algorithm. Additional 100 simulation results prove the effectiveness of the hybrid algorithm, with a solid performance to achieve the maximum productivity of robotic cell.

T2  - PROCEEDING OF 2020 6TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON WIRELESS AND TELEMATICS (ICWT)
CP  - 6th International Conference on Wireless and Telematics (ICWT)
AB  - The development of control system, especially in the field of robotics was improving more progress in efforts to complete human work. One of them is an automatic goods carrier robot system that used in industry. At present, the majority of automatic goods carrier robotsystem still usea human control. In this paper, a design of automatic system for robotic goods carriers will be presented. One of the challenges in the development of a goods transport robot system is how the robot can run stably when carrying goods. This study presents a design of goods carrier robot system based on line sensors and fuzzy logic control. The input that used in this fuzzy logic system are the light and weight which obtained from the BFD-1000 sensor and barometric sensor. Meanwhile, the output of fuzzy system are the speed of right motor and the left motor, in order to stabilize the robot movement when the load was added. The simulation was is done to get the membership function value. Based on the simulation results using a case study, it is known that the load carried is 210 grams and the living sensor is sensor -2.5. Then the simulation results obtained speed of right motor PWM value of 21,9 and speed of left motor PWM value of 64,4. So that the robot runs in a straight state.

TI  - Adaptive formation-switching of a multi-robot system in an unknown occluded environment using BAT algorithm
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT ROBOTICS AND APPLICATIONS
AB  - This decade has witnessed a paradigm shift in human-labor based rescue-surveillance operations. Research propositions have explored the possibility of replacing manual intervention for the management of catastrophic situations by a team of robots. However, to implement the concept into practice, the robotics community has faced several challenges. The multi-robotic system has to be duly coordinated efficaciously by controllers to automate the operations thereby saving the lives of the rescuers. Subsequently, the controller/s should be able to ensemble the robots forming a particular shape depending on the varying environmental conditions. Moreover, it would allow the group to switch its current formation so that the system could maneuver towards the target while avoiding static/dynamic obstacles. To address these challenges, we have proposed a hierarchical control strategy so that the robots could maintain a strong inter-agent cohesiveness and simultaneously could switch their formation in the face of the changing situations and could pursue the goal of arriving towards the target. The formation control law has been designed based on the echolocation principle of the bio-inspired bat algorithm. The algorithm, corroborated by the simulation results and the real-time experiments is exceptionally useful for forming the desired pattern, changing the formation adaptively whenever obstructions show up in their trajectories.

TI  - Video Content Analysis for Compliance Audit in Finance and Security Industry
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
AB  - The quality and accessibility of modern financial service have been quickly and dramatically improved, which benefits from the fast development of information technology. It has also witnessed the trend for applying artificial intelligence related technology, especially machine learning to the finance and security industry ranging from face recognition to fraud detection. In particular, deep neural networks have proven to be far superior to traditional algorithms in various application scenarios of computer vision. In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based video analysis system for automated compliance audit in stock brokerage, which in general consists of five modules here: 1) Video tampering and integrity detection; 2) Objects of interest localization and association; 3) Analysis of presence and departure of personnel in a video; 4) Face image quality assessment; and 5) Signature action positioning. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that introduces remote automated compliance audit system for the dual-recorded video in finance and security industry. The experimental results suggest our system can identify most of the potential non-compliant videos and has greatly improved the working efficiency of the auditors and reduced human labor costs. The collected dataset in our experiment will be released with this paper.

TI  - Differential evolution algorithm for solving RALB problem using cost- and time-based models
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY
AB  - Assembly process is one of the important aspects in manufacturing industries. Industries are extensively using advanced technologies in assembly lines recently such as robots instead of human labor. Cost associated with human labor such as wages, training, safety, and employee management are eliminated with the help of robots. Investments on assembly lines are cost intensive, and industries continuously need to maximize their utilization. In this paper, a cost-based robotic assembly line balancing (RALB) problem with an objective of minimizing assembly line cost and cycle time is addressed. Moreover, there is no research reported on concurrently optimizing cycle time and assembly line cost for a robotic assembly line system to date. The objective of this paper is to propose models with dual focus on time and cost to minimize the cycle time and total assembly line cost simultaneously. Time-based model with the primary focus to optimize cycle time and the cost-based model with the primary focus to optimize total assembly line cost are developed. Due to NP-hard nature, differential evolution (DE) is the algorithm used to solve the RALB problem. Straight and U-shaped robotic assembly line problems are solved using the proposed algorithm, and the detailed comparisons of the results obtained are presented. While comparing straight and U-shaped RALB problems, assembly line cost and cycle time obtained by U-shaped RALB problems are better than the straight RALB problems. The proposed models have significant managerial implications, and these have been discussed in detail.

TI  - Development of a high-endurance cleaning robot with scanning-based path planning and path correction
T2  - MICROSYSTEM TECHNOLOGIES-MICRO-AND NANOSYSTEMS-INFORMATION STORAGE AND PROCESSING SYSTEMS
AB  - The cleaning of large-scale indoor public spaces is currently performed by workers driving cleaning machines. However, labor shortages are becoming more acute, resulting in human labor being substituted with robotics solutions for the cleaning of large public facilities (e.g., airport terminals, stations, and underground commercial streets). With the rapid development of sensing and automation technologies, various types of large-scale cleaning robots have been proposed. However, due to difficulty in precise indoor positioning, cleaning along a preplanned path is still challenging for robots. Therefore, this study proposes a cleaning robot that maps large indoor spaces using laser scanning and can avoid obstacles. The chassis of the robot has two independent primary wheels and two auxiliary wheels as power and support; direct current (DC) is employed to power the vacuum cleaner and the robot's drive motor, to prevent power loss due to DC-alternating current conversion. An indoor facility undergoes three-dimensional laser scanning, and the cleaning space is then mapped through matrix graphics; subsequently, a path is planned using the boustrophedon method. The distance to the wall, measured by the laser rangefinder, is employed as a reference for the correction of the robot's movement. The powerful vacuum cleaner design of the proposed cleaning robot was experimentally confirmed as having the ability to suction trash. In addition, the proposed robot was shown to clearly identify obstacles through laser scanning and successfully avoid them during the cleaning process to complete the cleaning task along the preplanned cleaning route.

TI  - New Approach of Telerobotic over Internet
T2  - WORLD CONGRESS ON ENGINEERING AND COMPUTER SCIENCE, VOLS 1 AND 2
CP  - World Congress on Engineering and Computer Science (WCECS)/International Conference on Advances in Engineering Technologies
AB  - Telerobotics actually result from the merger of two originally separate areas that are teleoperation and robotics. Indeed, autonomous robotics are not yet fully developed, the robot must now be operated remotely by a human operator. We must therefore take into account the principles developed in teleoperation. However, as the robot can perform basic tasks independently, it is called telerobotics rather than teleoperation. Telerobotics has applications wherever man has difficulty working directly (hostile environment, too far or too small places) and the tasks are sufficiently complex or unpredictable to be an obstacle to full automation. The main condition for the development of telerobotics is the ability to compete with the direct intervention of humans or the use of an automated highly specialized. In the first case, the advantage of telerobotics is firstly the replacement of human labor painful or dangerous by another, more secure and more comfortable. In the second case, we must show the interest of a material more versatile than the automatic system dedicated to the proposed application.

TI  - Internal Determinants in the Field of RPA Technology Implementation on the Example of Selected Companies in the Context of Industry 4.0 Assumptions
T2  - INFORMATION
AB  - As part of the assumptions of Industry 4.0. many modern technologies are developing. One of them is robotic process automation (RPA). It allows the replacement of human labor with robots, thus increasing the production capacity of enterprises. In practice, the implementation of RPA takes place through two solutions (models): using the services of an external entity offering RPA (service insourcing) or creating your own center of excellence (CoE). The use of both solutions is influenced by numerous conditions (determinants), among which we can mention benefits on the one hand and threats on the other. They are very different and depend on the model used. In this article, attempts were made to identify and determine their impact on the selection of the appropriate model from the point of view of the company (the purpose of the article). The research used two cases of entities implementing RPA on the basis of opposites, i.e., two different models, in which the discussed technology is treated as an important element of their automation. The achieved results indicate that there is no universalism, and their dominant feature is individualism concerning both enterprises and the solutions they implement. This is undoubtedly the effect of the currently too shallow RPA market, as well as the small number of entities using technologies based on intelligent systems. This is a serious research gap, which along with RPA growth will be reduced as a result of more and more intensive research in this field.

AB  - In recent years, the technology-driven industrial upgrading in China has resulted in human labor being replaced with robots. This article explores the impact of "intelligent manufacturing" on workers from the following two perspectives: labor relations and the labor process. The authors argue that workers on the shopfloor are experiencing some forms of labor degradation due to robotization, i.e., more flexible labor relations, deskilling, and strengthened technical control. Such a corporation-led and machine-centered industrial upgrading is driven by state policy, capital, and the labor market.

T2  - TECHNOLOGY IN SOCIETY
AB  - The growing use of robots in the current ICT revolution has sparked a serious debate about the potential threat robots pose to human labour. In parallel, the convergence towards a more sustainable economy has caused a transformation of firms and a consequent restructuring of employment. In this article we investigate the problem of technological unemployment and environmental rebound effect by looking at how relationships between jobless growth, industrial robots usage, CO2 emissions, and renewable energy consumption changed over time in China and South Korea. Findings from a competition model based on differential equations for the period 2008-2018 show that robots do not always increase unemployment growth. On the other hand, the type of relationship between unemployment and sustainable use of energy changes over time, questioning the possibility of a smart green new deal.

TI  - Bound-guided hybrid estimation of distribution algorithm for energy-efficient robotic assembly line balancing
T2  - COMPUTERS & INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING
AB  - Under the pressure of climate change, energy-efficient manufacturing has attracted much attention. Robotic assembly lines are widely-used in automotive and electronic manufacturing. It is necessary to consider the energy saving and economic criteria simultaneously when robots are utilized to operate assembly tasks replacing human labor. This paper addresses an energy-efficient robotic assembly line balancing (EERALB) problem with the criteria to minimize both the cycle time and total energy consumption. We present a multi-objective mathematical model and propose a bound-guided hybrid estimation of distribution algorithm to solve the problem. When designing the optimization algorithm, we adopt estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) to tackle the task assignment, and design a non-dominated robot allocation (NGRA) heuristic which is embedded into the EDA to allocate suitable robot to each workstation. Moreover, we propose a bound-guided sampling (BGS) method, which is able to reduce the search space of EDA and focus the search on the promising area. The computational complexity of the proposed algorithm is analyzed and the effectiveness of the proposed NGRA and BGS is tested. In addition, we compare the performances of the proposed mathematical model and the proposed algorithm with those of the existing model and algorithms on a set of widely-used benchmark instances. Comparative results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and algorithm.

TI  - Analysis of the Impact of Human-Cobot Collaborative Manufacturing Implementation on the Occupational Health and Safety and the Quality Requirements
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Implementing Industry 4.0 and interconnected robotization in industrial enterprises drifts towards occupational changes. Nowadays, the task is to create cooperation and collaboration between a robot and a human in a common robotized workplace so that it is safe and effective. The type of robot, the robotic device that works in collaboration with a human operator, is called a cobot. In the case of a closer interaction of the robot or cobot with humans, it is necessary to consider where it is possible to replace human work entirely or where it is possible to merely supplement it. The most socially acceptable option is the implementation of robots only for the performance of supplementary tasks, since the traditional work positions of people in manufacturing processes would remain largely preserved. On the other hand, workplace robotization is particularly suitable for work environments with hazardous chemical substances that are carcinogenic and toxic to humans. Similarly, robotization helps to improve workplace ergonomics and also to avoid, for humans, very laborious and often repetitive work. The SWOT analysis (analysis of Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats) was used as a relevant tool to assess various aspects of the impact of increasing robotization on working positions in industrial enterprises. SWOT analysis is an indicative assessment of the suitability of implementation of robots in a given workplace, which helps to create an optimal solution and indicate new areas of needed analysis and research directions.

T2  - 11TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON CONTROL, AUTOMATION, ROBOTICS AND VISION (ICARCV 2010)
CP  - 11th International Conference on Control, Automation, Robotics and Vision (ICARCV 2010)
AB  - Robotic devices are increasingly penetrating the human work spaces as stand alone units and helpers. It is believed that a robot could be easily integrated with humans, if the robot can learn how to behave in a socially acceptable manner. This involves a robot to observe, learn and comply with basic rules of human behaviors. As an example, one would expect a robot to travel in an environment without intruding human workspaces unnecessarily. Thus, identifying common motion patterns of people by observing a specific environment is an important task as people's trajectories are usually not random, however are tailored to the way the environment is structured. We propose a learning algorithm to construct a Sampled Hidden Markov Model (SHMM) that captures behavior of people through observations and then demonstrate how this model could be exploited for planning socially aware paths. Experimental results are presented to demonstrate the viability of the proposed approach.

T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE ASME INTERNATIONAL DESIGN ENGINEERING TECHNICAL CONFERENCES AND COMPUTERS AND INFORMATION IN ENGINEERING CONFERENCE, 2014, VOL 5B
CP  - ASME Design Engineering Technical Conferences and Computers and Information in Engineering Conference (DETC)
AB  - Farming consumes considerable energy, natural resources and intensive human labor. Robotic assisted farmer can make farming activities more precise and more efficient; particularly it may remedy shortage of farmers in the future. A planter is a mechanism which performs precision seeding. Design of a planter in the optimum manner that needs minimum draft force when attached to a mobile robot, was the main objective of this work. A planter was developed, fabricated and tested in the course of a research project.
   The main motivation for this research is the fact that a mobile robot, is an electric powered vehicle with limited power and pulling force. Thus, a customized planter with a customized connection mechanism should be designed that can be pulled by mobile robot. The developed planter should have the same efficiency as the existing planters in seeding.
   To study the interaction between soil engagement tool (disc coulter) and soil, experiments were performed in the Linear Soil Bin. Different parameters of the disc coulter were changed and the draft force, vertical force and side force were measured. The results of the experiments were used to find the optimum parameters of the disc that caused minimum draft force. A novel planter was designed and fabricated; it was attached to a mobile robot, and field tested. Tests performed in outdoor and indoor settings showed satisfactory results. Draft force developed on the planter was close to analytical value and performance of the planter in other aspects was as expected.

This effect also occurs if the presence of others replaced to robot. Furthermore, previous research shows that the effects on a person being touched by a robot to motivate him or her. However, direct contact such as touch with robot has a risk of disturbing human work. The authors use gaze tracking for social facilitation, because gaze tracking can also facilitate human efforts. The authors implemented social facilitation robot agent by using gaze tracking. The agent projects its face on the surface to show quickly changing expression which is difficult for achieve by ordinally robots. The agent also can express gaze tracking by implemented eye trackers. The authors prepared three conditions with monotonous task for comparing the effect of gaze tracking, first: the agent gazes the aim of task, second: the agent moves its gaze randomly, third: the agent traces the gaze point of participant. The result showed that the participant raise motivation if the agent traces gazed point by human, even though there are no the different on achievement score of task and continuation time.

TI  - Toward energy-efficient online Complete Coverage Path Planning of a ship hull maintenance robot based on Glasius Bio-inspired Neural Network
T2  - EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS
AB  - Regular Ship hull maintenance is an essential for sustainability. The maintenance work of ship hulls that involve human labor suffers from many shortcomings. Maintenance robots have been introduced for drydocks to eliminate these shortcomings. An energy-efficient Complete Coverage Path Planning (CCPP) is a crucial requirement from a ship hull maintenance robot. This paper proposes a novel energy-efficient CCPP method based on Glasius Bioinspired Neural Network (GBNN) for a ship hull inspection robot. The proposed method accounts for a comprehensive energy model for path planning. This energy model reflects the energy usage of a ship hull maintenance robot due to changes in direction, distance, and vertical position. Furthermore, the proposed method is effective for dynamic workspaces since it performs online path planning. These are the major contributions made to state of the art by the work proposed in this paper. The behavior and the performance of the proposed method have been compared against state of the art through simulations considering Hornbill, a multipurpose ship hull maintenance robot. The validation confirms the ability of the proposed in realizing a complete coverage of a given dynamic workspace. According to the statistical outcomes of the comparison, the performance of the proposed method significantly surpasses that of the state-of-the-art methods in terms of energy usage. Therefore, the proposed method contributes to the development of energy-efficient CCPP methods for a ship hull maintenance robot.

TI  - Taxation of robots - what would have been the view of Smith and Marx on it?
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOCIAL ECONOMICS
AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to approach the issue of taxation of robotic process automation (RPA) through an interpretive lens provided by both Adam Smith and Karl Marx. Both scholars have affected the understanding and attitudes of generations of economists, and their ideas have considerable influenced modern economic policy. It will be argued that Smith and Marx have much to offer to help contemporary economists understand the taxation of RPA, and their writings on machines, automation, and their impact on the human labor force will be discussed from their primary texts. Design/methodology/approach The paper interprets the works of Marx and Smith in relation to contemporary debates on automation, particularly, proposals to tax technological innovations to offset the social costs of automation's displacement effects. Findings In the case of Adam Smith, there is not enough evidence to suggest that he would support a specific taxation of RPA; however, he very well might agree with a modest taxation of capital goods. Marx would very likely support a taxation in the short-run, however, would be inclined to caution that the ownership of robots should in the long run be transferred to society. Originality/value This paper uses primary texts from the discipline of history of economic thought to spark a discussion about compensating the externalities of technological innovation.

TI  - Analysis of A Proposed Algorithm for Point to Point Control of A 3 DOF Robot Manipulator
T2  - 2017 3RD INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON CONTROL, AUTOMATION AND ROBOTICS (ICCAR)
CP  - 3rd IEEE International Conference on Control, Automation and Robotics (ICCAR)
AB  - Industrial robots exhibit how human labor can be automated due to the evolution of automation. The control of robotic manipulators for industrial applications is a booming field of research. Precision is one of the major factors that is taken into consideration for the evaluation of performance in such manipulators. In this paper, an algorithm has been developed for a point to point controlled 3 DOF model of a spatial robot. Further, simulation studies were carried out and also tested in real life. A set of inverse kinematic equations have been developed which enables to derive a relationship between joint angles, length of links and the desired position in relation to the initial position (Homing position). This is then compared to an algorithm that is designed using rotation matrices with small incremental prediction to achieve minimum error. An analysis between inverse kinematics and the simplified proposed algorithm is done to compare performance characteristics, primarily focusing on accuracy on repeated testing. The two results are compared and it is observed that the proposed algorithm gives better accuracy than the conventional method.

TI  - Are machines stealing our jobs?
T2  - CAMBRIDGE JOURNAL OF REGIONS ECONOMY AND SOCIETY
AB  - This study aims to contribute empirical evidence to the debate about the future of work in an increasingly robotised world. We implement a data-driven approach to study the technological transition in six leading Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries. First, we perform a cross-country and cross-sector cluster analysis based on the OECD-STAN database. Second, using the International Federation of Robotics database, we bridge these results with those regarding the sectoral density of robots. We show that the process of robotisation is industry- and country-sensitive. In the future, participants in the political and academic debate may be split into optimists and pessimists regarding the future of human labour; however, the two stances may not be contradictory.

TI  - Specifically human: Human work and care in the age of machines
T2  - BUSINESS ETHICS-A EUROPEAN REVIEW
AB  - This paper aims to show how the frequently asked question about the future of work, that is, whether human beings are going to be replaced by machines and robots, arose, and why the way such question is posed is inadequate to account for the human and social value of care professions. We discuss how the dimensions entailed in care professions are specifically human and argue that any kind of human work actually reflects them (and will reflect them in the future), irrespective of the impact of technological changes. The present argument also aims to unveil the extent of the effects of the postmodern epistemological crisis regarding the concept of work, to reformulate the question about the future of human work, and to offer a characterization of care as a specific component of human work in the age of machines.

TI  - Co-evolutionary particle swarm optimization algorithm for two-sided robotic assembly line balancing problem
T2  - ADVANCES IN MECHANICAL ENGINEERING
AB  - Industries utilize two-sided assembly lines for producing large-sized volume products such as cars and trucks. By employing robots, industries achieve a high level of automation in the assembly process. Robots help to replace human labor and execute tasks efficiently at each workstation in the assembly line. From the literature, it is concluded that not much work has been conducted on two two-sided robotic assembly line balancing problems. This article addresses the two-sided robotic assembly line balancing problem with the objective of minimizing the cycle time. A mixed-integer programming model of the proposed problem is developed which is solved by the CPLEX solver for small-sized problems. Due to the problems in non-polynomial- -hard nature, a co-evolutionary particle swarm optimization algorithm is developed to solve it. The co-evolutionary particle swarm optimization utilizes local search on the global best individual to enhance intensification, modification of global best to emphasize exploration, and restart mechanism to escape from local optima. The performances of the proposed co-evolutionary particle swarm optimization are evaluated on the modified seven well-known two-sided assembly line balancing problems available in the literature. The proposed algorithm is compared with five other well-known metaheuristics, and computational and statistical results demonstrate that the proposed coevolutionary particle swarm optimization outperforms most of the other metaheuristics for majority of the problems considered in the study.

TI  - An implementation of a teleoperation system for robotic beam assembly in construction
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRECISION ENGINEERING AND MANUFACTURING
AB  - Recently, a robot-based construction automation (RCA) project was finished in Korea, whose purpose was to employ a robotic system instead of human labor in steel beam assembly tasks. In that research, a robotic beam assembly (RBA) system was developed to execute a beam assembly task. A field application using the RBA system at an actual construction site was completed. Because a human operator had to board the cabin and manipulate the system in the air, causing possible safety problems, a teleoperation system was developed and is the subject of this paper. To evaluate the performance of the teleoperation system, a pointing task experiment based on Fitts' law was conducted to determine whether it obeyed speed-accuracy tradeoff rules. Results are discussed and an overview of the actual bolting test using the teleoperation system is presented here. Finally, conclusions are drawn about the feasibility of implementing an RBA system with teleoperation in actual building construction applications.

TI  - Learning effects and mental fatigue of forklift operators in food retail logistics: An empirical analysis through the lens of behavioral operations management
T2  - IFAC PAPERSONLINE
CP  - 17th IFAC Symposium on Information Control Problems in Manufacturing (INCOM)
AB  - Even though the ongoing digital transformation in the forms of artificial intelligence and robotics offer promising concepts on automating warehouse operations, a majority of processes in intralogistics rely on manual human work. Since order picking has been identified as the most labour-intensive, as well as costly activity in warehouses, forklift operators receive significantly less attention in research. To shed light on the cognitive aspects of forklift operators, this paper aspires to quantify the learning process for n = 5 forklift operators and mental fatigue effects for another n = 5 operators in a retail warehouse for cooled and perishable items. Our results indicate that learning, as well as fatigue effects, can be observed in this field of operations and are measurable through a multivariable parametric approach. 2021 IFAC Copyright (C) 2021 The Authors.

TI  - Falcon: A False Ceiling Inspection Robot
T2  - SENSORS
AB  - Frequent inspections are essential for false ceilings to maintain the service infrastructures, such as mechanical, electrical, and plumbing, and the structure of false ceilings. Human-labor-based conventional inspection procedures for false ceilings suffer many shortcomings, including safety concerns. Thus, robot-aided solutions are demanded for false ceiling inspections similar to other building maintenance services. However, less work has been conducted on developing robot-aided solutions for false ceiling inspections. This paper proposes a novel design for a robot intended for false ceiling inspections named Falcon. The compact size and the tracked wheel design of the robot allow it to traverse obstacles such as runners and lighting fixtures. The robot's ability to autonomously follow the perimeter of a false ceiling can improve the productivity of the inspection process since the heading of the robot often changes due to the nature of the terrain, and continuous heading correction is an overhead for a teleoperator. Therefore, a Perimeter-Following Controller (PFC) based on fuzzy logic was integrated into the robot. Experimental results obtained by deploying a prototype of the robot design to a false ceiling testbed confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed PFC in perimeter following and the robot's features, such as the ability to traverse on runners and fixtures in a false ceiling.

TI  - State-of-the-art and adoption of artificial intelligence in retailing
T2  - DIGITAL POLICY REGULATION AND GOVERNANCE
AB  - Purpose In the most abstract way, artificial intelligence (AI) allows human work to be shifted toward technological systems that are currently not fully capable. Following this, the domain of retail can be sketched as a natural fit for the application of AI tools, which are known for their high proportion of human work and concurrent low profit margins. This paper aims to explore the current dissemination of the application of AI within the industry. The value-added core tasks of retail companies are examined to determine the possible utilization and the market adoption within the globally largest retail companies is given. Design/methodology/approach The paper uses two different approaches to identify the scientific state-of-the-art: a search on the major scientific databases and an empirical study of the ten largest international retail companies and their adoption of AI technologies in the domains of wholesale and retail. Findings The application within the different value-added core tasks varies greatly depending on the area. In summary, there are numerous possible applications in all areas. Especially, in areas where future forecasts are needed within the task areas (such as marketing or replenishment), the use of AI, today, is both scientifically and practically highly developed. In contrast, the market adoption of AI is highly variable. The pioneers have integrated extensive applications into everyday business, while the challengers are investing heavily in new initiatives. Some others, however, show neither active use nor any effort to adopt such technology. Originality/value To the best of the author's knowledge, this is one of the first research contributions to analyze the areas of application and the impact of AI structured along the value-added core processes of retail companies.

TI  - Discrete cuckoo search algorithms for two-sided robotic assembly line balancing problem
T2  - NEURAL COMPUTING & APPLICATIONS
AB  - Robotics are extensively utilized in modern industry to replace human labor and achieve high automation and flexibility. In order to produce large-size products, two-sided assembly lines are widely applied, where robotics can be employed to operate tasks on workstations. Since the applied traditional optimization methods are limited, the current work presented a new discrete cuckoo search algorithm to solve the two-sided robotic assembly line balancing problem. The original cuckoo search algorithm was modified by employing neighbor operations. Furthermore, a new procedure to generate individuals to replace the abandoned nests was developed to enhance the intensification. Since the considered problem has two subproblems, namely the robot allocation and assembly line balancing, the present work extended the cuckoo search algorithm to cooperative coevolutionary paradigm by dividing the cuckoos into two sub-swarms, each addressing a subproblem. In order to emphasize the exploration, a restart mechanism was employed. The proposed discrete algorithm's evolution process and convergence were compared with another two popular optimization algorithms, namely the genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimization algorithm. Computational study on the proposed algorithms and other five recent algorithms along with statistical analysis demonstrated that the proposed methods yielded promising results.

CP  - IEEE/ASME International Conference on Advanced Intelligent Mechatronics (AIM)
AB  - These days, agricultural work still involves demanding and exhausting duties. The application of autonomous robots is a possible way to support human labor in the field. By adapting the robots to several tasks, like harvesting or cultivation of different types of crop, costs can be reduced while the flexibility of the system is increased. Thus, in this paper several concepts of modular agricultural manipulators for sweet-pepper, apples, and grapes are presented and discussed. In order to achieve dexterous manipulation and to be able to avoid obstacles, redundant robots are investigated. Kinematic as well as dynamic simulation models are applied for system design and evaluation. Finally, the developed manipulator and first control results are introduced. Both, simulations and measurements, demonstrate the principal suitability of the system.

AB  - Nowadays, the era of Industrial Revolution 4.0 (4IR) has resulted the advancement of technology in the manufacturing engineering industry. Robotic technology is one of the main drivers that plays an important role in realizing the growth IR4.0. In the manufacturing industry, robots are widely used to replace human labor and enhance the flexibility in the assembly process. Thus, it has motivated many authors to study on Robotic Assembly Line Balancing (RALB). Numerous researchers have developed mathematical models and optimization techniques in solving RALB problems. This paper aims to conduct a survey on the objective functions regarding the mathematical models and to give a review on metaheuristic, heuristic, and exact methods that commonly applied to this problem. 24 papers from 2009 until 2019 were reviewed in order to see the study trend in aspects of objective function and method used in this area. It can be seen that metaheuristics are extensively used to minimize the cycle time in RALB. The literature review in RALB may highlight a research gap and give guidance for future work.

T2  - 2014 IEEE SYMPOSIUM ON COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE IN ROBOTIC REHABILITATION AND ASSISTIVE TECHNOLOGIES (CIR2AT 2014)
CP  - IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence in Robotic Rehabilitation and Assistive Technologies (CIR2AT)
AB  - Human-scale mobile robots with arms have the potential to assist people with a variety of tasks. We present a proof-of-concept system that has enabled a person with severe quadriplegia named Henry Evans to shave himself in his own home using a general purpose mobile manipulator (PR2 from Willow Garage). The robot primarily provides assistance by holding a tool (e.g., an electric shaver) at user-specified locations around the user's head, while he/she moves his/her head against it. If the robot detects forces inappropriate for the task (e.g., shaving), it withdraws the tool. The robot also holds a mirror with its other arm, so that the user can see what he/she is doing. For all aspects of the task, the robot and the human work together. The robot uses a series of distinct semi-autonomous subsystems during the task to navigate to poses next to the wheelchair, attain initial arm configurations, register a 3D model of the person's head, move the tool to coarse semantically-labeled tool poses (e.g, "Cheek"), and finely position the tool via incremental movements. Notably, while moving the tool near the user's head, the robot uses an ellipsoidal coordinate system attached to the 3D head model. In addition to describing the complete robotic system, we report results from Henry Evans using it to shave both sides of his face while sitting in his wheelchair at home. He found the process to be long (54 minutes) and the interface unintuitive. Yet, he also found the system to be comfortable to use, felt safe while using it, was satisfied with it, and preferred it to a human caregiver.

AB  - The 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, the epidemic of the Ebola virus, and currently the COVID-19 pandemic is an essential wake-up call for all countries to transform the approach to soil assessment and environmental management, and these diseases have proved how quickly a new virus can spread to every corner of the globe. With so many countries declaring the state of the emergency protocol due to the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, adopting and intensifying the provisions for the fourth industrial revolution technologies such as robotics and state-of-the-art mobile laboratories could be the only way to transform and expedite the approach to soil assessment, mapping, monitoring, and environmental management. This article proposes the four(th) industrial revolution methodologies that can be adapted to assist the farmers and community in managing soils and the environment when the world nations are in a predicament of the pandemic such as COVID-19. The task would be to develop an outdoor automated or semi-autonomous machine vision system (drone or a robot) that can exceptionally substitute human labour on soil management tasks that are critical and cannot be performed by human labour as a result of COVID-19 national lockdown and any other related limitations of infield conventional assessment methods.

TI  - Automation and robotics in the cultivation of pome fruit: Where do we stand today?
T2  - JOURNAL OF FIELD ROBOTICS
AB  - The cultivation of apples and pears in orchards consists of several tasks that still demand much human labor. The cost of this skilled labor increases while the number of competent seasonal workers becomes insufficient. These facts are a threat to the fruit industry. To find a solution, this paper addresses current as well as future automation possibilities for the main orchard tasks as a profitable alternative to human labor. Besides an activity research in pome fruit orchards, this paper contains an overall review of the research and developments that have been performed to automate each major activity (e.g., pruning, thinning, spraying, harvesting and mobile navigating) in the cultivation of pome fruit. These tasks are individually evaluated on feasibility and profitability of the developed automations. Finally, this paper concludes that, despite the large amount of research, almost no fully automated and cost-efficient solution has been developed. A possible option to increase the viability of the prototypes might be the simplification of the tree structures, and consequently the orchard architecture, to make it "robot-ready." Another option in this perspective is combining several techniques, for accomplishing individual tasks, in one multipurpose robot platform. As a result, the usability and efficiency of the robot increases.

T2  - 2017 INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON MICRO-NANOMECHATRONICS AND HUMAN SCIENCE (MHS)
CP  - 28th Int Symposium on Micro-NanoMechatronics and Human Science (MHS) - From Micro and Nano Scale Systems to Robotics and Mechatronics Systems / Symposium on Understanding Brain Plasticity on Body Representations to Promote Their Adaptive Functions
AB  - Precision Agriculture using mobile robot aimed to increase efficiency and quality of crops treatment and monitoring, since robot can produce better result in term of data quality and accuracy than manual treatment by human labor. Limited by technology development and complexity of agricultural environment, precision agriculture nowadays is still not fully-autonomous, but partially autonomous to handle more simpler but need high accuracy - tasks. Some of them is mapping and monitoring task. This research proposed a method for generating map in simulated agricultural area using Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM), by generating grid-based/volumetric map using fine-tuned SLAM-Gmapping algorithm and combine it with properties/informations obtained from each detected crops/plants using fruit detection with visual sensor and tree location detection using 2D laser scanner sensor. Experiment conducted in simulation environment Gazebo and Robot Operation System (ROS) for scenario of simulated fruit mapping in apple farm, and give a good result with a good accuracy.

TI  - Incidental cerebral aneurysms detected by a computer-assisted detection system based on artificial intelligence A case series
T2  - MEDICINE
AB  - Rationale: Computer-assisted detection (CAD) systems based on artificial intelligence (AI) using convolutional neural network (CNN) have been successfully used for the diagnosis of unruptured cerebral aneurysms in experimental situations. However, it is yet unclear whether CAD systems can detect cerebral aneurysms effectively in real-life clinical situations. This paper describes the diagnostic efficacy of CAD systems for cerebral aneurysms and the types of cerebral aneurysms that they can detect.
   Patient Concerns: From March 7, 2017 to August 26, 2018 we performed brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans for 1623 subjects, to rule out intracranial diseases. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records including the history and images for each patient.
   Diagnoses, interventions and outcomes: Among them, we encountered 5 cases in whom the cerebral aneurysms had been overlooked in the first and second round of imaging, and were detected for the first time by CAD. All missed aneurysms were less than 2 mm in diameter. Of the 5 aneurysms, 2 were internal carotid artery (ICA) paraclinoid aneurysms, 2 were Internal carotid-posterior communicating artery (IC-PC) aneurysms and 1 was a distal middle cerebral artery (MCA) aneurysm.
   Lessons: Our CAD system can detect very small aneurysms masked by the surrounding arteries and difficult for radiologists to detect. In the future, CAD systems might pave the way to substitute the workload of diagnostic radiologists and reduce the cost of human labor.

TI  - Human factors in the justification of an advanced manufacturing system
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HUMAN FACTORS IN MANUFACTURING
AB  - A central part of the design of a production system is to methodically weigh the production factors, labor, and capital (machines, robots, etc.) and integrate them into a well-functioning unit. The purpose of this article is to analyze the impact of human factors on the design of an Advanced Manufacturing System (AMS). The impact is illustrated in a case study of a Swedish engineering company. An investment in automated spot welding is justified in a Life-Cycle Cost analysis. In this case, the company's economic incentives for automation were increased. Furthermore, the labor-related additional costs motivated additional automation where all monotonous tasks were eliminated. The result was a highly automated manufacturing system, offering human work tasks with more variety and less static work load. (C) 1996 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

TI  - Experimental study of effectiveness of robotic cleaning for fish-processing plants
T2  - FOOD CONTROL
AB  - This paper presents the development and experimental testing of the effectiveness of a robotic cleaning system for fish processing plants. The processing of fish introduces a substantial risk of bacterial contamination, which can cause the spoilage of fish and pose a threat to consumers' health. Good operational hygiene and precautions, in addition to regular cleaning of the processing plants, are necessary for the reduction of the risk of contamination. The state-of-the art cleaning techniques currently include manual cleaning operations of fish processing plants. The experiments of robotic cleaning presented in this paper were performed in two rounds. First, a test using a conventional low-cost industrial robot mounted on a vertical linear axis was used. As the results from this test seemed promising, a second robotic system was built aiming at a more industrialized version. This system consisted of a serial manipulator, tailored for the task, mounted on a horizontal transportation system, and a comparison was conducted between the cleaning performed by human operators and that performed by the robotic system. An electrical stunner with a connected conveyor belt, which is a typical installation for salmon processing plants, was experimentally inoculated with a cocktail of fish-spoilage bacteria that were allowed to develop a biofilm. Back-to-back cleaning trials with biofilms of Pseudomonas fluorescens, Pseudomonas putida, and Photobacterium phosphoreum confirmed that the industrialized robotic prototype performed equally well or better than the conventional manual cleaning procedure currently used in the industry. The results demonstrate that a robotic system can deliver satisfactory results in the cleaning of fish processing plants, thereby minimizing the potential for the spread of contamination. The proposed robotic concept allows for an automated cleaning system, reduced human labor, increased profitability for the industry, and better stability of the cleaning process.

T2  - CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS OF 2017 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON CIRCUITS, DEVICES AND SYSTEMS (ICCDS)
CP  - International Conference on Circuits, Devices and Systems (ICCDS)
AB  - Current manufacturing processes use robots for obtaining higher accuracy, higher precision, and fast response in the process. Deburring is one of important processes in metal forming processes. This research is aimed to design double arms SCARA robot for deburring process. The robot motion analysis used SolidWorks Motion Analysis in order to obtain the rotational angles of motors of the robot arms. In the motion analysis, two robot arms have identical rotational angles. They can also work parallel to each other as prescribed by users. The rotational angles were used to control the robot movement by using teach pendant method. The result shown that robot can be deburred two of the 10 holes of PCB board within 60 second and reduced manufacturing time, which is 2 times of work of human workforce

TI  - Artificial intelligence and creative activities inside organizational behavior
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ORGANIZATIONAL ANALYSIS
AB  - Purpose This study aims to investigate about the use of artificial intelligence (AI) (man machine relationship) regarding organizational behavior. The aim of this research paper is to analyze whether the current AI is used also to replace man in "creative" activities. Design/methodology/approach This study is based on a qualitative and explorative approach. It is made a review of the literature with "Scopus" and "Web of Science" databases. The research fields are AI, organizational behavior, man-machine relationship and creativity. Findings Analyzing whether the intensive use of AI in organizational behavior can replace human work in creative activities. Research limitations/implications The connection of AI with creative activities within the organization is only just beginning. For this reason, other sources, like Harvard Business Review, public reports and professional papers found on the internet have been considered. The most important limitation of this paper is that all the results presented here do not concern a single case study. Practical implications In this paper, there are some examples that can show the use of AI in creative activities; however, this does not complete the situation facing companies in any sector because the AI technologies used within enterprises are constantly evolving. It is possible to continue to do research in this field. Originality/value The paper is meaningful because highlights the development of AI toward creative activities typically of human resources. It is also interesting because it analyzes the exploratory use of AI in increasingly human work, generating positive and negative externalities.

TI  - Big tech and societal sustainability: an ethical framework
T2  - AI & SOCIETY
AB  - Sustainability is typically viewed as consisting of three forces, economic, social, and ecological, in tension with one another. In this paper, we address the dangers posed to societal sustainability. The concern being addressed is the very survival of societies where the rights of individuals, personal and collective freedoms, an independent judiciary and media, and democracy, despite its messiness, are highly valued. We argue that, as a result of various technological innovations, a range of dysfunctional impacts are threatening social and political stability. For instance, robotics and automation are replacing human labor and decision-making in a range of industries; search engines, monetized through advertising, have access to, and track, our interests and preferences; social media, in connecting us to one another often know more about us than we ourselves do, enabling them to profit in ways which may not coincide with our well-being; online retailers have not only acquired the ability to track and predict our buying choices, but also they can squeeze vendors based on their outsize bargaining power; and, in general, virtual technologies have changed both the way we think and our sense of self. With the rising deployment of the Internet of Things, and developments in machine learning and artificial intelligence, the threats to individual freedoms and rights, societal cohesion and harmony, employment and economic well-being, and trust in democracy are being ratcheted up. This paper lauds the benefits and addresses the harm wrought by the high tech giants in Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs). The search for rapidly growing revenues (and shareholder returns and stock prices) drives firms to accelerate product innovation without fully investigating the entire gamut of their impacts. As greater wealth accrues to the leaders of tech firms, inequalities within firms and societies are widening, creating social tensions and political ferment. We explore the ethical nature of the challenge employing a simple utilitarian calculus, complemented by approaches rooted in rights, justice, and the common good. Various options to address the challenges posed by ICTs are considered and evaluated. We argue that regulation may do little more than slow down the damage to society, particularly since societal values and political preferences vary internationally. Firms need to establish ethical standards, imbuing the upholders of these standards with sufficient authority, while creating a culture of morality. User involvement and activism, and shareholders' concerns for the sustainability of societies on whose continued prosperity they depend, are imperative to humanity's ability to decide the future direction of technology.

TI  - Automation and robotics in mining: Jobs, income and inequality implications
T2  - EXTRACTIVE INDUSTRIES AND SOCIETY-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL
AB  - Although mining is a capital-intensive industry, its contribution to employment creation is generally praised as a leading local benefit to justify new or expanding extraction projects. However, labour substitution from automation and robotics is increasing in a wide range of modern mining processes. Such labour replacement is likely to intensify in the coming years due to advances and cost reductions in technology. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic also adds to the impetus of relying less on human interaction for critical operational processes. In this paper, we provide some insights on the global trends of automation/robotics in mining and discuss the main economic impacts that increasing human labour substitution could bring to mining communities, regions, and nations. We focus on mining automation/robotics impacts on jobs, income (including taxes), and regional inequality. We conclude by discussing policy options that governments could consider for mitigating these impacts, including the reskilling of miners and tax transfers.

TI  - Philosophy of Social Robotics: Abundance Economics
T2  - SOCIAL ROBOTICS, (ICSR 2016)
CP  - 8th International Conference on Social Robotics (ICSR)
AB  - The aim of this paper is to present conceptual resources that address social robotics from a philosophical, social, and economic perspective. Since social robotics is an emerging and potentially high-impact area, it is necessary to consider the ethics and philosophy of social robotics and its potential impact on society. Philosophical, economic, and ethical issues are addressed first generally, revealing that social robotics is most-centrally a situation of human-machine collaboration. Second, economic issues are examined more specifically, positing that social robotics might figure prominently in both an automation economy that focuses on reduced requirements for human labor and an abundance economy that targets improved human quality of life. The stakes of social robotics are high and could mean both quantitative and qualitative benefits, and take advantage of the close connection with humans to help negotiate and buffer interactions between humans and a world with an increasing and expanding presence of technology.

TI  - Development of multipurpose robot for vegetable production
T2  - JARQ-JAPAN AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH QUARTERLY
AB  - The objective of these studies was to develop a multipurpose intelligent robot for vegetable production. Many of the vegetable-producing operations are presently performed by human labor, because they need to be carried out selectively. In this study, the robot which consisted mainly of a rectangular manipulator, a traveling device and computer (80286 CPU) was constructed on an experimental basis. The outline of the robot and its application to transplanting, weed control and harvesting for several leafy vegetables in the hill space are reported. Two types of transplanting and harvesting hands were tested. Weed location was determined by processing color images, and the weeds were removed with a blade constructed experimentally. As a result, it was shown that 1) cabbage and spinach seedlings could be transplanted with a hand constructed on an experimental basis, 2) weeds could be accurately determined and 3) leafy vegetables like spinach could be harvested with the hand with reciprocating knives.

T2  - 2005 IEEE/RSJ INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INTELLIGENT ROBOTS AND SYSTEMS, VOLS 1-4
CP  - IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems
AB  - In this paper, we propose a novel interaction model for a human-robot cooperative task. The CEA (Commands Embedded in Actions) model reduces a human work-load because a user of a robot needs less inputs and outputs than DCM (Direct Commanding methods) like gesturing. We propose ECEA (Extended CEA) in order to deal with more complicated tasks than CEA. On the cooperative sweeping task between a human and a mobile robot, we apply temporal extension as one of ECEA instances. Mmultiple commands are embedded in the human action by the extention and the robot performs more complicated task. The experiments for conforming reduction of a human work-load using ECEA are conduced on the sweeping task. Human cognitive loads are measured as human workloads and compared between ECEA and DCM. The results of the experiments showed that the ECEA minimized a human cognitive load.

TI  - An intelligent Alzheimer's disease diagnosis method using unsupervised feature learning
T2  - JOURNAL OF BIG DATA
AB  - Today, the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) has attracted the attention of researchers in this field owing to the increase in the occurrence of the diseases and the need for early diagnosis. Unfortunately, the nature of high dimension of neural data and few available samples led to the creation of a precise computer diagnostic system. Machine learning techniques, especially deep learning, have been considered as a useful tool in this field. Inspired by the concept of unsupervised feature learning that uses artificial intelligence to learn features from raw data, a two-stage method was presented for an intelligent diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. At the first stage of learning, scattered filtering, an uncontrolled two-layer neural network was used to directly learn features from raw data. At the second stage, SoftMax regression was used to categorize health statuses based on the learned features. The proposed method was validated by the data sets of Alzheimer's Brain Images. The results showed that the proposed method achieved very good diagnostic accuracy and was better than the existing methods for brain image data sets. The proposed method reduces the need for human work and makes it easy to intelligently diagnose for big data processing, because the learning features are adaptive. In our experiments with the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) data, a dual and multi-class classification was conducted for AD/MCI diagnosis and the superiority of the proposed method in comparison with the advanced methods was shown.

TI  - Real-time path optimization of mobile robots based on improved genetic algorithm
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS PART I-JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS AND CONTROL ENGINEERING
AB  - The emergence of intelligent mobile robots has liberated the human labor to a certain extent, especially their abilities to work in harsh environments in place of humans. For intelligent mobile robots, how to achieve fast path optimization is an important issue. In this article, the model establishment method of environmental information collected by robot sensors and the genetic algorithm for real-time optimization of running paths are briefly introduced first, the crossover, mutation probability, and fitness function are improved based on the shortcomings of the traditional genetic algorithm, and then the simulation analysis of the two algorithms is carried out using matrix laboratory (MATLAB) software. The results show that the improved algorithm obtains a smaller length of optimal path, fewer inflection points, and a smaller turning angle, which also converges faster and has a greater degree of fitness. It takes 0.053 s for the traditional algorithm to calculate the optimal path, while the improved algorithm needs 0.013 s. In summary, the improved genetic algorithm can quickly and efficiently calculate the optimal path, which is suitable for real-time path optimization of mobile robots.

TI  - A descriptive statistical analysis of volume, visibility and attitudes regarding nursing and care robots in social media
T2  - CONTEMPORARY NURSE
AB  - Background: Technology in the healthcare sector is undergoing rapid development. One of the most prominent areas of healthcare in which robots are implemented is nursing homes. However, nursing and technology are often considered as being contradictory, an attitude originating in the view of "the natural" versus "the artificial". Social media mirror this view, including in attitudes and societal debates regarding nursing and care robots. However, little is known about this topic in previous research.
   Objectives: To examine user behaviour in social media platforms on the topic of nursing and care robots.
   Design: A retrospective and cross-sectional observation study design was applied.
   Methods: Data were collected via the Alchemy streaming application programming interface. Data from social media were collected from 1 January 2014 to 5 January 2016. The data set consisted of 12,311 mentions in total.
   Results: Nursing and care robots are a small-scale topic of discussion in social media. Twitter was found to be the largest channel in terms of volume, followed by Tumblr. News channels had the highest percentage of visibility, while forums and Tumblr had the least. It was found in the data that 67.9% of the mentions were positive, 24.4% were negative and 7.8% were neutral.
   Discussion: The volume and visibility of the data on nursing robots found in social media, as well as the attitudes to nursing robots found there, indicate that nursing care robots, which are seen as representing a next step in technological development in healthcare, are a topic on the rise in social media. These findings are likely to be related to the idea that nursing care robots are on the breakthrough of replacing human labour in healthcare worldwide.

T2  - AUTONOMOUS AIR AND GROUND SENSING SYSTEMS FOR AGRICULTURAL OPTIMIZATION AND PHENOTYPING III
CP  - Conference on Autonomous Air and Ground Sensing Systems for Agricultural Optimization and Phenotyping III
AB  - This paper presents the use of machine learning techniques for the development of a methodology for the analysis of digital images of citrus plants collected from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Proven ground based sensors including a chlorophyll meter, water potential meter, and spectroradiometer are used to evaluate the condition of the plants, thus providing the ground truth. The collected images and ground truth data are then used as training data to the machine learning models, which are validated using a separate set of data. For our models, we evaluate several machine learning techniques from simple linear regression to convolutional neural networks. The overall goal is to develop a solution for monitoring plant health that can readily and cost-effectively be used by farmers to determine nitrogen and water stresses in plants. Such a system will aid in the conservation of physical resources while reducing human labor and the environmental impact of chemicals.

TI  - A Feasibility Study of a Robotic Approach for the Gluing Process in the Footwear Industry
T2  - ROBOTICS
AB  - Manufacturing processes in the shoe industry are still characterized to a large extent by human labour, especially in small and medium craft enterprises. Even when machinery is adopted to support manufacturing operations, in most cases an operator has to supervise or carry out the task. On the other hand, craft footwear industries are called to respond to continuous challenges to face the globalization effects, so that a rapid adaptability to customer needs is required. The industry 4.0 paradigms, which are taking place in the industrial environments, represent an excellent opportunity to improve the efficiency and quality of production, and a way to face international competitors. This paper analyses and proposes a robotic cell to automatize the process of glue deposition on shoe upper, which exploits a new means of depositing the glue compared to State-of-Art applications. While the latter mainly adopt glue gun spraying systems or pneumatic syringes, the proposed robotic cell is based on an extrusion system for the deposition of molten material originally in the form of a filament, similar to all extent to those adopted for Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM). Two cell solutions are designed and tested. In the former the extruder is the robot end effector and the shoe upper is grounded to the cell frame. In the second, being the reciprocal, the shoe last is clamped to the robot wrist and the extruder is fixed to the cell frame. The peculiarities of the two solutions are pointed out and compared in terms of cell layout, hardware, programming software and possibility to develop collaborative applications. A self developed slicing software allows designing the trajectories for glue deposition based on the CAD model of the shoe upper, also allowing driving the inclination of the extruder nozzle with respect to the vectors normal to the upper surface. Both the proposed cell layouts permit to achieve good quality and production times. The solution with the mobile extruder is able to deposit glue at highest end-effector speed (up to 200 mm/s). On the other hand, the solution with the mobile shoe upper and fixed extruder seems to be more appropriate to enhance collaborative applications.

TI  - A deep learning model for identifying diabetic retinopathy using optical coherence tomography angiography
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB  - As the prevalence of diabetes increases, millions of people need to be screened for diabetic retinopathy (DR). Remarkable advances in technology have made it possible to use artificial intelligence to screen DR from retinal images with high accuracy and reliability, resulting in reducing human labor by processing large amounts of data in a shorter time. We developed a fully automated classification algorithm to diagnose DR and identify referable status using optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) images with convolutional neural network (CNN) model and verified its feasibility by comparing its performance with that of conventional machine learning model. Ground truths for classifications were made based on ultra-widefield fluorescein angiography to increase the accuracy of data annotation. The proposed CNN classifier achieved an accuracy of 91-98%, a sensitivity of 86-97%, a specificity of 94-99%, and an area under the curve of 0.919-0.976. In the external validation, overall similar performances were also achieved. The results were similar regardless of the size and depth of the OCTA images, indicating that DR could be satisfactorily classified even with images comprising narrow area of the macular region and a single image slab of retina. The CNN-based classification using OCTA is expected to create a novel diagnostic workflow for DR detection and referral.

CP  - 27th International Conference on Automated Planning and Scheduling (ICAPS)
AB  - Optimizing policies for real-time control of humanoid robots is a difficult task due to the continuous and stochastic nature of the state and action spaces. In this paper, we propose a learning procedure to train a predictive motion model and RFPI, a solver for continuous-state and action MDP. We use the predictive model as a transition model to train policies for a robot soccer. Our method requires no external hardware, a small amount of human work and manages to outperform the expert policy used by our team Rhoban winning the last 2016 edition of the Robocup in kid-size soccer league. Moreover, the proposed method is able to adapt to non-holonomic robots more efficiently than the expert approach. Our results are confirmed by both simulations and real robot experiments.

TI  - Priorities of training of digital personnel for industry 4.0: social competencies vs technical competencies
T2  - ON THE HORIZON
AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to determine the priorities of formation of competencies during training of digital personnel for industry 4.0. Design/methodology/approach The author performs two experiments for determining the scenario according to which industry 4.0 develops and will develop: the first experiment is aimed at determining the influence of the number of robots at unemployment level in 2019 and 2022 with the help of regression and correlation analysis (regression curves are built). The second experiment is connected to evaluation of the ratio of the number of robots to the number of population in 2019 and 2022. The research objects are countries with the highest number of robots in the world - i.e. with the highest level of development of industry 4.0; the information and empirical basis is materials of the International Federation of Robotics and the International Monetary Fund for 2019 and their forecasts for 2022. Findings The results of the performed experiments showed that in 2019 and 2022 the level of robotization of socio-economic systems of the countries of the world will be very low, and robotization will not cause growth of unemployment. Based on this, it is concluded that industry 4.0 will be developing according to the scenario of moderate automatization and robotization with preservation of domination of human labor in most business processes and spheres of economy. Communications with people will constitute the basis of the activities of digital personnel, and social competencies (with obvious significance of technical competencies) will be of top priority for them. Originality/value It is substantiated that technical competencies, with their large importance, will move to the background, while the key task will be society's adaptation to the new technological mode and making social competencies the highest priority. The social and technical competencies of digital personnel in view of the performed tasks for industry 4.0 are determined.

TI  - Robust multi-objective multi-humanoid robots task allocation based on novel hybrid metaheuristic algorithm
T2  - APPLIED INTELLIGENCE
AB  - Nowadays humanoid robots have generally made dramatic progress, which can form a coalition replacing human work in dangerous environments such as rescue, defense, exploration, etc. In contrast to other types of robots, humanoid robots' similarity to human make them more suitable for performing such a wide range of tasks. Rescue applications for robots, especially for humanoid robots are exciting. In rescue operating conditions, tasks' dependencies, tasks' repetitive accomplishment requirements, robots' energy consumption, and total tasks' accomplishment time are key factors. This paper investigates a practical variant of the Multi-Robots Task Allocation (MRTA) problem for humanoid robots as multi-humanoid robots' task allocation (MHTA) problem. In order to evaluate relevant aspects of the MHTA problem, we proposed a robust Multi-Objective Multi-Humanoid Robots Task allocation (MO-MHTA) algorithm with four objectives, namely energy consumption, total tasks' accomplishment time, robot's idle time and fairness were optimized simultaneously in an evolutionary framework in MO-MHTA, which address for the first time. MO-MHTA exhibits multi-objective properties in real-world applications for humanoid robots in two phases. In the first phase, the tasks are partitioned in a fair manner with a proposed constraint k-medoid (CKM) algorithm. In the second phase, a new non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm with special genetic operators is applied. Evaluations based on extensive experiments on the newly proposed benchmark instances with three robust multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) are applied. The proposed algorithm achieves favorable results in comparison to six other algorithms. Besides, the proposed algorithm can be seen as benchmark algorithms for real-world MO-MHTA instances.

TI  - Computation of cause and effect relationship for acceptance of autonomous mobile robots in industries
T2  - JOURNAL OF STATISTICS & MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS
AB  - Autonomous mobile robot (AMR) is a programmed machine capable of maneuvering through obstacle free path to reach destination thereby reducing human labor. Prerequisite for an AMR is to self-navigate through arduous and unknown waypoints in dynamic or real-time situations over a shortest path which demands software and hardware development and interaction, using abundant electronic and mechanical components. AMRs are necessary for industries working in 24-7 work schedule to alleviate user's performance and curb wear and tear of components in industries. Several factors govern acceptance of AMR in industries based on user feedback. In this work, authors have analyzed computationally user preferences for AMR acceptance in industries, and demonstrated their cause and effect relationship using fuzzified DEMATEL and priority ranking through TOPSIS method which has not been done previously. The results provide novel and better understanding of user behavior and attitude towards AMRs. Findings, thus, provide implications for predicting user behavior and suggest directives to increase willingness of AMR usage.

TI  - Automated sleep stage scoring of the Sleep Heart Health Study using deep neural networks
T2  - SLEEP
AB  - Study Objectives: Polysomnography (PSG) scoring is labor intensive and suffers from variability in inter- and intra-rater reliability. Automated PSG scoring has the potential to reduce the human labor costs and the variability inherent to this task. Deep learning is a form of machine learning that uses neural networks to recognize data patterns by inspecting many examples rather than by following explicit programming.
   Methods: A sleep staging classifier trained using deep learning methods scored PSG data from the Sleep Heart Health Study (SHHS). The training set was composed of 42 560 hours of PSG data from 5213 patients. To capture higher-order data, spectrograms were generated from electroencephalography, electrooculography, and electromyography data and then passed to the neural network. A holdout set of 580 PSGs not included in the training set was used to assess model accuracy and discrimination via weighted F1-score, per-stage accuracy, and Cohen's kappa (K).
   Results: The optimal neural network model was composed of spectrograms in the input layer feeding into convolutional neural network layers and a long short-term memory layer to achieve a weighted F1-score of 0.87 and K = 0.82.
   Conclusions: The deep learning sleep stage classifier demonstrates excellent accuracy and agreement with expert sleep stage scoring, outperforming human agreement on sleep staging. It achieves comparable or better F1-scores, accuracy, and Cohen's kappa compared to literature for automated sleep stage scoring of PSG epochs. Accurate automated scoring of other PSG events may eventually allow for fully automated PSG scoring.

AB  - This paper a study of a vehicle that goes over small objects by indoor. Recently, the robot industry market has spread. Among them, many companies advancing the introduction and utilization of service robots purpose to the substitution of human work. Consequently, only 60% answered that they were achieved results. The reason for the low results is that conventional robots do not have enough size, traveling performance and positioning accuracy. In this study, after examining the robot implementation and the conventional robot, we aim at the one that functions sufficiently the size, traveling performance and omnidirectional movement within the indoor environment. To this end, we propose a vehicle that can move in omnidirectional and can move each foot independently in the vertical direction. In the experiment of this study, a distance sensor was attached to the foot to detect the front floor height. When the floor height fluctuated, it was considered that there were small objects, and the foot was raised according to the height of them, and they were gone over. As a result, the sensor could detect small objects and realize the going over action. In the future, we aim to realize autonomous driving by combining it with the technology of omnidirectional movement.

CP  - 4th International Scientific Research Conference on Information Technologies in Science, Management, Social Sphere and Medicine (ITSMSSM)
AB  - Attempts of the society to facilitate human work and life led to the creation of robots. Unfortunately, there are no existing social agricultural robots yet. If we combine the functions of agricultural robots used on a private plot of land or a vegetable garden and the functions of social robots realized in interaction with humans into a social agricultural robot, we can get some kind of hybrid, i.e. robot-companion and assistant, used for personal purposes. This robot is another unofficial member of the rural household. Authors believe that a social agricultural robot is a technical tool, a machine capable of social interaction with a person and performing horticultural, livestock, meliorative, and service types of work. It will be able to implement the function of performing agricultural operations and a communicative one. To create it, a high level of technology development will be required: computer vision, understanding of speech, sensory networks, bionic systems, navigation systems, power supplies. A sociological survey conducted showed that Russian rural population see social agricultural robots as helpers on a plot of land, in the garden and in the house. The result obtained is interesting because it allows us to talk about further modifications of social agricultural robots. At present, the creation of such robots would make work and life of the rural population easier and safer and solve some problems of preserving the ecology. Social agricultural robots could work with pesticides which are harmful to human health; implement technologies of point agriculture and resource saving; provide employment for people with disabilities in agricultural activities; increase the mobility of the rural population through the use of remote management; participate in the organization of leisure and self-education of people.

T2  - 2019 IEEE INTERNATIONAL GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING SYMPOSIUM (IGARSS 2019)
CP  - IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)
AB  - The land-use map is an important data that can reflect the use and transformation of human land, and can provide valuable reference for land-use planning. For the traditional image classification method, producing a high spatial resolution (HSR), land-use map in large-scale is a big project that requires a lot of human labor, time, and financial expenditure. The rise of the deep learning technique provides a new solution to the problems above. This paper proposes a fast and precise method that can achieve large-scale land-use classification based on deep convolutional neural network (DCNN). In this paper, we optimize the data tiling method and the structure of DCNN for the multi-channel data and the splicing edge effect, which are unique to remote sensing deep learning, and improve the accuracy of land-use classification. We apply our improved methods in the Guangdong Province of China using GF-1 images, and achieve the land-use classification accuracy of 81.52%. It takes only 13 hours to complete the work, which will take several months for human labor.

AB  - In recent years, along with the aging of society worldwide, decrease of working population has become a serious problem. For this reason, robots are expected to substitute human work, automate distribution, and support human daily life, especially, elderly care assistance. In this research, we focus on the support of those who need care in everyday life, and, in this paper, we propose a human-robot cooperative system that supports acquisition of objects in cooperation with a human. The outline of the action of this robot is as follows: (i) It moves to the location designated by a user autonomously (not by remote control): (ii) On arrival, the robot exchanges information by video with the user who is at a remote place, and acquires the objects designated by the user among those placed there. (iii) After the acquisition, the robot moves again autonomously to the user and hands over the objects to the user. In this paper, we focus on step (ii) and show methods and some experimental results.

TI  - What Should We Do After Work? Automation and Employment Law
T2  - YALE LAW JOURNAL
AB  - Will advances in robotics, artificial intelligence, and machine learning put vast swaths of the labor force out of work or into fierce competition for the jobs that remain? Or, as in the past, will new jobs absorb workers displaced by automation? These hotly debated questions have profound implications for the fortress of rights and benefits that has been constructed on the foundation of the employment relationship. This Article charts a path for reforming that body of law in the face of justified anxiety and uncertainty about the future impact of automation on jobs.
   Many of the forces that drive automation-including law-related labor costs-also drive firms' decisions about "fissuring," or replacing employees with outside contractors. Fissuring has already transformed the landscape of work and contributed to weaker labor standards and growing inequality. A sensible response to automation should have in mind this adjacent problem, and vice versa. Unfortunately, the dominant legal responses to fissuring - which aim to extend firms' legal responsibility for the workers whose labor they rely on - do not meet the distinctive challenge of automation, and even modestly exacerbate it. Automation offers the ultimate exit from the costs and risks associated with human labor. As technology becomes an ever-more-capable and cost-effective substitute for human workers, it enables firms to circumvent prevailing legal strategies for protecting workers and shoring up the fortress of employment.
   The question is how to protect workers' rights and entitlements while reducing firms' incentive both to replace employees with contractors and to replace human workers with machines. The answer, I argue, begins with separating the issue of what workers' entitlements should be from the issue of where their economic burdens should fall. Some worker rights and entitlements necessarily entail employer duties and burdens. But for those that do not, we should look for ways to shift their costs off of employer payrolls or to extend the entitlements themselves beyond employment. The existing fortress of employment-based rights and benefits is under assault from fissuring and automation; it is failing to protect those who remain outside its walls and erecting barriers to some who seek to enter. We should dismantle some of its fortifications and construct in its place a broader foundation of economic security for all, including those who cannot or do not make their living through steady employment.

TI  - Development of Track Wheel for In-pipe Robot Application
T2  - 2015 IEEE INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON ROBOTICS AND INTELLIGENT SENSORS (IEEE IRIS2015)
CP  - IEEE International Symposium on Robotics and Intelligent Sensors (IEEE IRIS)
AB  - At present, the application of pipelines in industries is becoming more severe. The application is not limited for home application only but it can stretch up to thousands of kilometers across countries. Pipelines are used to transport water, sewage, flammable liquid, high pressure gasses and oil. In order to ensure efficient pipelines performance, the pipelines need to undergo routine monitoring, maintenance and repairing activities. However, due to the nature of pipelines that are long, interconnected, and sometimes buried underground or far beneath the sea make it hard to accomplish the tasks. Relying on human labor for the cleaning and maintenance process is not efficient, not safe and not economical. Therefore, there is a strong demand for a robot that can help the cleaning and repairing process in the pipelines. The main aim of this research is to produce an in-pipe robot. This paper will specifically discuss about the development of hardware and software of track wheel for in-pipe robot application. The Caterpillar concept has been chosen to be considered for further development. The Caterpillar that is equipped with special made track wheel is able to move and also climb in pipelines. The scope of this project is limited to 14 inner diameter of UPVC pipe. The development of the wheel track has followed a systematic engineering design process. Experiments have been conducted to validate the software and hardware. As a result, the developed track wheel successfully climbed up to 300 without skidding or slipping. Consequently, the designed track wheel can be considered to be applied as locomotion of the in-pipe robot. The track wheel can be used to move, climb and maneuver the robot in the pipeline smoothly.

T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF 2015 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON FLUID POWER AND MECHATRONICS - FPM 2015
CP  - International Conference on Fluid Power and Mechatronics FPM
AB  - As for machine parts with irregular shaped face edges, they are usually chamfered by human labor or chamfering machines which grind along the irregular edges with positon control. Especially some machine parts may have multiple space plane to be chamfered, which also need certain high chamfering quality. To solve this problem, a new machine part chamfering robot is designed, which is based on force compensation control. The chamfering robot mainly consists of vertical axis (Y-Axis), horizontal axis (X-Axis), compensation axis and rotation axis. X-Y table conducts interpolation motion to track the work piece. Meanwhile, the rotation axis, fixing with work piece, can rotate to meet the demand of multiple space contour processing. And the key component is the compensation axis (C-Axis) which has been equipped with a force sensor along the axis. So the compensation axis can receive real time feedback force signal. And according to the preliminary simulation, the friction compensation which is based on the exponential friction model is added to reflect and approximate the real axial cutting force to realize constant force processing while other double axes simultaneously motion to achieve trajectory tracking. Focused on PID control strategy, the control system of the compensation axis and X-Y table, as well as the X-Y-C axes of chamfering robot is analyzed. Furthermore the simulation models are respectively built in this paper. Finally simulation results show that by using force compensation control, the machine part chamfering robot can process with good quality and high efficiency.

T2  - ECONOMICS OF INNOVATION AND NEW TECHNOLOGY
AB  - In this paper, the Directed Technical Change model was extended to consider robotics and the monetary authority. Production, in two sectors, uses human labor and robotic labor, in addition to the intermediate goods where technological knowledge is incorporated. It resulted that the growth-inflation relationship is negative (positive) when there is substitutability (complementarity) between sectors. In addition, a relaxation of the CIA's restrictions on one sector promotes an improvement in technological knowledge of that sector and in the remuneration of the labor it uses. Both the direction of technological knowledge and the relative return on human labor depend positively on the relative importance of the human sector in the economy, the relative productivity of the human sector in R&D, and the increasing financial constraints for R&D producers in the robotic sector relative to the human sector. Finally, a numerical analysis gave an idea of the relative remuneration of human labor in the eurozone and allows the evaluation of theoretical results.

TI  - Deep Learning for End-to-End Atrial Fibrillation Recurrence Estimation
T2  - 2018 COMPUTING IN CARDIOLOGY CONFERENCE (CINC)
CP  - 45th Computing in Cardiology Conference (CinC)
AB  - Left atrium shape has been shown to be an independent predictor of recurrence after atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation. Shape-based representation is imperative to such an estimation process, where correspondence-based representation offers the most flexibility and ease-of-computation for population-level shape statistics. Nonetheless, population-level shape representations in the form of image segmentation and correspondence models derived from cardiac MRI require significant human resources with sufficient anatomy-specific expertise. In this paper, we propose a machine learning approach that uses deep networks to estimate AF recurrence by predicting shape descriptors directly from MRI images, with NO image pre-processing involved. We also propose a novel data augmentation scheme to effectively train a deep network in a limited training data setting. We compare this new method of estimating shape descriptors from images with the state-of-the-art correspondence-based shape modeling that requires image segmentation and correspondence optimization. Results show that the proposed method and the current state-of-the-art produce statistically similar outcomes on AF recurrence, eliminating the need for expensive pre-processing pipelines and associated human labor.

TI  - Teacher/Student Deep Semi-Supervised Learning for Training with Noisy Labels
T2  - 2018 17TH IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON MACHINE LEARNING AND APPLICATIONS (ICMLA)
CP  - 17th IEEE International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications (IEEE ICMLA)
AB  - Deep learning methods are at the forefront of leading state-of-the-art methods in a wide range of machine learning applications. In particular, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) attain topmost performance assuming a sufficiently large number of labeled training examples. Unfortunately, labeled data is artificially curated, and it requires human labor, which consequently makes it expensive and time-consuming. Moreover, there are no guarantees that the obtained labels are noise-free. In fact, the performance of CNNs is influenced by the level of noisy labels in the training dataset. Although the literature lacks attention to train learning methods with noisy labels, few semi-supervised learning methods mitigate this obstacle. In this paper, we propose a new teacher/student deep semi-supervised learning (TS-DSSL) method that employs self-training on noisy labels training dataset. We measure the efficiency of TS-DSSL on semi-supervised visual object classification tasks on the benchmark datasets CIFAR10 and MNIST. TS-DSSL achieves impressive results even in the presence of high-level noisy labels. It also sets a record on datasets with various levels of noisy labels created from the previous datasets with uniform and non-uniform noise distributions.

TI  - Crop Yield Estimation Using Deep Learning Based on Climate Big Data and Irrigation Scheduling
T2  - ENERGIES
AB  - Deep learning has already been successfully used in the development of decision support systems in various domains. Therefore, there is an incentive to apply it in other important domains such as agriculture. Fertilizers, electricity, chemicals, human labor, and water are the components of total energy consumption in agriculture. Yield estimates are critical for food security, crop management, irrigation scheduling, and estimating labor requirements for harvesting and storage. Therefore, estimating product yield can reduce energy consumption. Two deep learning models, Long Short-Term Memory and Gated Recurrent Units, have been developed for the analysis of time-series data such as agricultural datasets. In this paper, the capabilities of these models and their extensions, called Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory and Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Units, to predict end-of-season yields are investigated. The models use historical data, including climate data, irrigation scheduling, and soil water content, to estimate end-of-season yield. The application of this technique was tested for tomato and potato yields at a site in Portugal. The Bidirectional Long Short-Term memory outperformed the Gated Recurrent Units network, the Long Short-Term Memory, and the Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Units network on the validation dataset. The model was able to capture the nonlinear relationship between irrigation amount, climate data, and soil water content and predict yield with an MSE of 0.017 to 0.039. The performance of the Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory in the test was compared with the most commonly used deep learning method, the Convolutional Neural Network, and machine learning methods including a Multi-Layer Perceptrons model and Random Forest Regression. The Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory outperformed the other models with an R-2 score between 0.97 and 0.99. The results show that analyzing agricultural data with the Long Short-Term Memory model improves the performance of the model in terms of accuracy. The Convolutional Neural Network model achieved the second-best performance. Therefore, the deep learning model has a remarkable ability to predict the yield at the end of the season.

TI  - Unintended Side Effects of the Digital Transition: European Scientists' Messages from a Proposition-Based Expert Round Table
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - We present the main messages of a European Expert Round Table (ERT) on the unintended side effects (unseens) of the digital transition. Seventeen experts provided 42 propositions from ten different perspectives as input for the ERT. A full-day ERT deliberated communalities and relationships among these unseens and provided suggestions on (i) what the major unseens are; (ii) how rebound effects of digital transitioning may become the subject of overarching research; and (iii) what unseens should become subjects of transdisciplinary theory and practice processes for developing socially robust orientations. With respect to the latter, the experts suggested that the ownership, economic value, use and access of data and, related to this, algorithmic decision-making call for transdisciplinary processes that may provide guidelines for key stakeholder groups on how the responsible use of digital data can be developed. A cluster-based content analysis of the propositions, the discussion and inputs of the ERT, and a theoretical analysis of major changes to levels of human systems and the human-environment relationship resulted in the following greater picture: The digital transition calls for redefining economy, labor, democracy, and humanity. Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based machines may take over major domains of human labor, reorganize supply chains, induce platform economics, and reshape the participation of economic actors in the value chain. (Digital) Knowledge and data supplement capital, labor, and natural resources as major economic variables. Digital data and technologies lead to a post-fuel industry (post-) capitalism. Traditional democratic processes can be (intentionally or unintentionally) altered by digital technologies. The unseens in this field call for special attention, research and management. Related to the conditions of ontogenetic and phylogenetic development (humanity), the ubiquitous, global, increasingly AI-shaped interlinkage of almost every human personal, social, and economic activity and the exposure to indirect, digital, artificial, fragmented, electronically mediated data affect behavioral, cognitive, psycho-neuro-endocrinological processes on the level of the individual and thus social relations (of groups and families) and culture, and thereby, the essential quality and character of the human being (i.e., humanity). The findings suggest a need for a new field of research, i.e., focusing on sustainable digital societies and environments, in which the identification, analysis, and management of vulnerabilities and unseens emerging in the sociotechnical digital transition play an important role.

TI  - Smart Garbage Bin Based on AIoT
T2  - INTELLIGENT AUTOMATION AND SOFT COMPUTING
AB  - Waste management and monitoring is a major concern in the context of the environment, and has a significant impact on human health. The concept of the Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) can help people in everyday tasks in life. This study proposes a smart trash bin to help solve the problem of waste management and monitoring. Traditional methods of garbage disposal require human labor, and pose a hazard to the worker. The proposed smart garbage bin can move itself by using ultrasonic sensors and a web camera, which serves as its "eyes." Because the smart garbage bin is designed for indoor use and mobility, we use a Bluetooth beacon for location tracking, whereby the bin transmits a constant signal that the other devices in the environment can detect. A smart garbage bin was developed in this study to be used in the E315 research room in the Electrical Engineering Department of the National Chin-Yi University of Technology. An Android application was also developed to help users monitor waste in the smart bin.

TI  - High-throughput molecular testing of ticks using a liquid-handling robot
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ENTOMOLOGY
AB  - To meet the need for high-throughput sample testing, DNA extraction kits based on the 96-well plate format have been developed for use with blood and tissue samples. These methods have not been applied to DNA extractions from ticks. To meet this need, we developed a high-throughput method for DNA extraction and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing of tick samples. A liquid-handling robot was used to extract DNA in a 96-well binding column plate with vacuum manifold. The quantity, purity, and quality of DNA recovered from Ixodes scapularis Say, 1821. nymphs with this method were reproducible and comparable with existing manual DNA extraction techniques. The DNA yield from pools of five nymphal ticks averaged 0.432 +/- 0.04 mu g (95% CI). The robot also prepared real-time PCR reactions in 96-well plates, directly from the extracted DNA. A modification of the existing P20 tool resulted in accurate pipetting of 1- to 2-mu l volumes with a reproducibility of +/- 0.038 mu l when dispensing 1.0 mu l. By using this process, 96 samples can be extracted and tested while reducing human labor to approximate to 30 min.

TI  - Training dataset reduction on generative adversarial network
T2  - INNS CONFERENCE ON BIG DATA AND DEEP LEARNING
CP  - 3rd INNS Conference on Big Data and Deep Learning (INNS BDDL)
AB  - In recent years, generative model using neural network (GAN) has become an interesting field in machine learning. However, a study that investigates the effect of reducing training dataset for GAN model has not been conducted, while it is known that collecting images for training dataset requires a lot of human labor work. In this research, series of experiments with various amount of dataset have been conducted to get the idea of how small is the amount of dataset required for a GAN to work. It has been shown that the reduction to around fifty thousand images of dataset has gained a better result than a full amount dataset. Additionally, a new evaluation method for quantifying the performance of GAN network was also proposed, which can be considered later as another evaluation method for GAN framework.

AB  - Chatbots are software used in entertainment industry, businesses and user support. Chatbots are modeled on various techniques such as knowledge base, machine learning based. Machine learning based chatbots yields more practical results. Chatbot which gives responses based on the context of conversation tends to be more user friendly. The chatbot we are proposing demonstrates a method of developing chatbot which can follow the context of the conversation. This method uses TensorFlow for developing the neural network model of the chatbot and uses the nlp techniques to maintain the context of the conversation. This chatbots can be used in small industries or business for automating customer care as user queries will be handled by chatbots thus reducing need of human labour and expenditure.

TI  - Deep learning based segmentation for automated training of apple trees on trellis wires
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
AB  - Trellised fruiting-wall training systems are becoming standard for modern apple orchards due to their high fruit yield and quality, and their suitability to robotic operations in pruning and harvesting. In a common practice of training young apple trees to a trellis-trained canopy system in PNW region of US, trees branches are manually selected and then tied to horizontal trellis wires in 6 or 7 tiers. As manual training of apple trees to these modern orchard architectures is becoming challenging due to less availability of skilled human labor with quickly increased labor cost, automated training using sensing and robotic techniques could be an alternative solution. Segmenting trunks, branches, and trellis wires is a critical step in automating a tree training operation. In this study, a deep learning-based semantic segmentation method was developed for automatically performing this segmentation task. A Kinect V2 sensor was used to obtain the RGB and point cloud data of target trees. Then both Simple- and Foreground-RGB images were used for training a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based segmentation network (SegNet) to segment the trunk, branch, and trellis wire. Trunks and branches, which share some common features, were segmented from each other with accuracies of 0.82 and 0.89 for Simple-RGB images and 0.91 and 0.92 for Foreground-RGB images, respectively. Similarly, trellis wires, which have distinct features from both the trunk and branches, were segmented with accuracies of 0.92 and 0.97 for the Simple- and Foreground-RGB images, respectively. Obtained results showed that the performance of the developed semantic segmentation technique was better with Foreground-RGB images compared to the same with Simple-RGB images. Accuracy in identifying the segmented region boundaries in Foreground-RGB images, represented by the Boundary-F1 score, was 0.93, 0.89, and 0.91 for the trunk, branch, and trellis wire, respectively. These results showed a promising potential for adopting deep learning-based semantic segmentation for automating apple tree training in orchard environment.

TI  - Agency plus automation: Designing artificial intelligence into interactive systems
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
AB  - Much contemporary rhetoric regards the prospects and pitfalls of using artificial intelligence techniques to automate an increasing range of tasks, especially those once considered the purview of people alone. These accounts are often wildly optimistic, understating outstanding challenges while turning a blind eye to the human labor that undergirds and sustains ostensibly "automated" services. This long-standing focus on purely automated methods unnecessarily cedes a promising design space: one in which computational assistance augments and enriches, rather than replaces, people's intellectual work. This tension between human agency and machine automation poses vital challenges for design and engineering. In this work, we consider the design of systems that enable rich, adaptive interaction between people and algorithms. We seek to balance the often-complementary strengths and weaknesses of each, while promoting human control and skillful action. We share case studies of interactive systems we have developed in three arenasdata wrangling, exploratory analysis, and natural language translation-that integrate proactive computational support into interactive systems. To improve outcomes and support learning by both people and machines, we describe the use of shared representations of tasks augmented with predictive models of human capabilities and actions. We conclude with a discussion of future prospects and scientific frontiers for intelligence augmentation research.

TI  - The best task allocation process is to decide on one's own: effects of the allocation agent in human-robot interaction on perceived work characteristics and satisfaction
T2  - COGNITION TECHNOLOGY & WORK
AB  - New technologies are ever evolving and have the power to change human work for the better or the worse depending on the implementation. For human-robot interaction (HRI), it is decisive how humans and robots will share tasks and who will be in charge for decisions on task allocation. The aim of this online experiment was to examine the influence of different decision agents on the perception of a task allocation process in HRI. We assume that inclusion of the worker in the allocation will create more perceived work resources and will lead to more satisfaction with the allocation and the work results than a decision made by another agent. To test these hypotheses, we used a fictional production scenario where tasks were allocated to the participant and a robot. The allocation decision was either made by the robot, by an organizational unit, or by the participants themselves. We then looked for differences between those conditions. Our sample consisted of 151 people. In multiple ANOVAs, we could show that satisfaction with the allocation process, the solution, and with the result of the work process was higher in the condition where participants themselves were given agency in the allocation process compared to the other two. Those participants also experienced more task identity and autonomy. This has implications for the design of allocation processes: The inclusion of workers in task allocation can play a crucial role in leveraging the acceptance of HRI and in designing humane work systems in Industry 4.0.

TI  - FM Broadcast Monitoring Using Artificial Intelligence
T2  - RADIO SCIENCE
AB  - In recent decades, artificial intelligence has demonstrated successful applications in computer vision and natural language processing due to its breakthrough performance. In this paper, we propose a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN)-based method, characterized by acoustic features, for FM broadcast monitoring. The results show that the proposed DCNN model trained with the FBank feature extracted from FM audio files is capable of achieving nearly 100% accuracy in FM station identification tasks. Illegal broadcasting signals are then detected through a comparison with a radio frequency station database. Integrated with the trained DCNN model, an online FM broadcast monitoring system has been successfully implemented and deployed to help reduce human labor and automate the task of FM broadcast monitoring.

TI  - Interface architecture design for minimum programming in human-robot collaboration
T2  - 51ST CIRP CONFERENCE ON MANUFACTURING SYSTEMS
CP  - 51st CIRP Conference on Manufacturing Systems (CIRP CMS)
AB  - Many metal components, especially large-sized ones, need to be ground or deburred after turning or milling to improve the surface qualities, which heavily depends on human interventions. Robot arms, combining movable platforms, are applied to reduce the human work. However, robots and human should work together due to the fact that most of the large-sized parts belong to small-batch products, resulting in a large number of programming for operating a robot and movable platform. Targeting the problem, this paper proposes a new interface architecture towards minimum programming in human -robot collaboration. Within the context, a four-layer architecture is designed: user interface, function block (FB), functional modules and hardware. The user interface is associated with use cases. Then, FB, with embedded algorithms and knowledge and driven by events, is to provide a dynamic link to the relevant application interface (APIs) of the functional modules in terms of the case requirements. The functional modules are related to the hardware and software functions; and the hardware and humans are considered in terms of the conditions on shop floors. This method provides three-level applications based on the skills of users: (1) the operators on shop floors, can operate both robots and movable platforms programming -freely; (2) engineers are able to customise the functions and tasks by dragging/dropping and linking the relevant FBs with minimum programming; (3) the new functions can be added by importing the APIs through programming 2018 The Authors.

TI  - Vision-based modeling for film and multimedia production
T2  - APPLIED ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
AB  - Recovery of a three-dimensional (3-D) description of the world from images has been a central topic in computer vision from the early days of AI research and is currently becoming of great importance, particularly to the film and entertainment industries. In particular this article addresses the problems of preproduction and postproduction for 3-D compositing of graphics in film and of building multimedia content for computer entertainment systems, both areas of burgeoning activity currently driven extensively with expensive skilled human labor. In this article, we discuss how the particular requirements for accuracy and generality of these applications impact the choices of vision techniques and how the interactive nature of production systems can be exploited to bypass the difficulties of segmentation and scene understanding that has prevented equally successful systems from arising in traditional AI contexts. We show actual results of both preproduction and postproduction processes in film and multimedia production, including preproduction model building, postproduction alignment of 3-D mattes into film, and a combination of preproduction and postproduction for inserting 3-D graphics into a video scene. The article concludes with a discussion of how the technology can be profitably merged with existing production practices and how it can be extended to provide further capabilities in production of entertainment media.

TI  - Learning Object Localization and 6D Pose Estimation from Simulation and Weakly Labeled Real Images
T2  - 2019 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ROBOTICS AND AUTOMATION (ICRA)
CP  - IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)
AB  - Accurate pose estimation is often a requirement for robust robotic grasping and manipulation of objects placed in cluttered, tight environments, such as a shelf with multiple objects. When deep learning approaches are employed to perform this task, they typically require a large amount of training data. However, obtaining precise 6 degrees of freedom for ground-truth can be prohibitively expensive. This work therefore proposes an architecture and a training process to solve this issue. More precisely, we present a weak object detector that enables localizing objects and estimating their 6D poses in cluttered and occluded scenes. To minimize the human labor required for annotations, the proposed detector is trained with a combination of synthetic and a few weakly annotated real images (as little as 10 images per object), for which a human provides only a list of objects present in each image (no time-consuming annotations, such as bounding boxes, segmentation masks and object poses). To close the gap between real and synthetic images, we use multiple domain classifiers trained adversarially. During the inference phase, the resulting class-specific heatmaps of the weak detector are used to guide the search of 6D poses of objects. Our proposed approach is evaluated on several publicly available datasets for pose estimation. We also evaluated our model on classification and localization in unsupervised and semi-supervised settings. The results clearly indicate that this approach could provide an efficient way toward fully automating the training process of computer vision models used in robotics.

TI  - Machine learning-based real-time monitoring system for smart connected worker to improve energy efficiency
T2  - JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING SYSTEMS
AB  - Recent advances in machine learning and computer vision brought to light technologies and algorithms that serve as new opportunities for creating intelligent and efficient manufacturing systems. In this study, the realtime monitoring system of manufacturing workflow for the Smart Connected Worker (SCW) is developed for the small and medium-sized manufacturers (SMMs), which integrates state-of-the-art machine learning techniques with the workplace scenarios of advanced manufacturing systems. Specifically, object detection and text recognition models are investigated and adopted to ameliorate the labor-intensive machine state monitoring process, while artificial neural networks are introduced to enable real-time energy disaggregation for further optimization. The developed system achieved efficient supervision and accurate information analysis in real-time for prolonged working conditions, which could effectively reduce the cost related to human labor, as well as provide an affordable solution for SMMs. The competent experiment results also demonstrated the feasibility and effectiveness of integrating machine learning technologies into the realm of advanced manufacturing systems.

TI  - Field test of an autonomous cucumber picking robot
T2  - BIOSYSTEMS ENGINEERING
AB  - At the Institute of Agricultural and Environmental Engineering (IMAG B.V.) an autonomous harvesting robot for Cucumbers was developed and tested in a greenhouse in autumn 2001. Analysis of the harvest process had revealed that at a 2 ha Dutch production facility four robots are needed to replace the skilled human work force during the peak season. Then assuming a success rate of 100%, a harvest cycle might take at most 10 s per cucumber fruit. In this paper the results of the field test of the harvesting robot are reported and analysed in view of the performance criteria mentioned above. Cucumbers (Cucumis sativus cv. Korinda) were grown in a high-wire cultivation system. In four independent experiments the robot was tested. The average success rate was 74.4%. The majority of failures originated from inaccurate positioning of the end-effector at the stalk of the fruit. It was found to be a great advantage that the system was able to perform several harvest attempts on a single cucumber from different harvest positions of the robot. This improved the success rate considerably. A single successful harvest cycle took 65.2s per cucumber. Since not all attempts were successful, a cycle time of 124 s per harvested cucumber was measured under practical circumstances. The test confirmed the ability to harvest more than one cucumber using a single set of images which reduced the cycle time of a successful harvest to 56.7 and 53.0 s if two or three cucumbers were harvested. To bridge the gap between the measured performance and the design specifications, future research focuses on improving the success rate, faster hardware and software for image processing and motion planning as well as the reduction of the motion time of the manipulator.

TI  - Process Evaluation of an Open Architecture Real-Time Molecular Laboratory Platform
T2  - JALA
AB  - The needs of molecular diagnostic laboratories that perform both Food and Drug Administration-cleared as well as laboratory-developed tests are usually not met on a single analytical platform. Furthermore, little information is available about the direct impact of molecular automation on labor costs and efficiency in clinical laboratories. We performed a process impact analysis from time and motion studies of a novel molecular diagnostic robotic system designed to automate sample preparation, extraction, and analysis. All 27 preanalytical tasks were quantified for the amount of time spent preparing 24 specimens for analysis. These steps were completed in 899 s (14 min, 59 s) followed by 7887 s (131 min, 27 s) of instrument operation independent of operator control (walk-away time). Postanalytical results evaluation required 1 min per specimen. The instrument automatically extracted the nucleic acid from the specimen, added the eluted DNA to the amplification reagents, and performed the analysis. Only 12% of the total instrument operations required relatively unskilled human labor. Thus, the availability of automated molecular diagnostic instruments will facilitate the expansion of molecular testing in the clinical laboratory because they reduce operator costs with respect to time and complexity of the tasks they are asked to perform.

AB  - This paper presents a comprehensive empirical comparison between two approaches for developing a base noun phrase chunker: human rule writing and active learning using interactive real-time human annotation. Several novel variations on active learning are investigated, and underlying cost models for cross-modal machine learning comparison axe presented and explored. Results show that it is more efficient and more successful by several measures to train a system using active learning annotation rather than hand-crafted rule writing at a comparable level of human labor investment.

TI  - Monitoring sugar crystallization with deep neural networks
T2  - JOURNAL OF FOOD ENGINEERING
AB  - Human labor still play an important role in cane sugar crystallization process. Automation control is essential to reduce human labor. An accurate image classification system is the basis for automation control of the cane sugar crystallization process. This paper builds a deep learning framework based on deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) to classify cane sugar crystallization image of cane sugar crystallization process for sugar factory. Different networks were trained on a large image data set obtained from a sugar batch crystallizer. Based on the data set, the established model was used to classify cane sugar crystallization image. The classification accuracy of the proposed model reached 0.901. The confusion matrix of the InceptionResNetV2 model indicates classification accuracy of between 0.83 and 0.99 are achieved in classifying cane sugar crystal images from a cane sugar factory into 5 categories. This provides a promising means for the future development of monitoring systems using image. The proposed DCNNs model was compared against other models, such as, Inception-V3, ResNet50, and a simple DCNNs. The experimental results showed that the deep learning framework outweighs other models and can serve as a benchmark of monitoring cane sugar crystallization using DCNNs in sugar industry.

TI  - A Convolution Neural Network-Based Seed Classification System
T2  - SYMMETRY-BASEL
AB  - Over the last few years, the research into agriculture has gained momentum, showing signs of rapid growth. The latest to appear on the scene is bringing convenience in how agriculture can be done by employing various computational technologies. There are lots of factors that affect agricultural production, with seed quality topping the list. Seed classification can provide additional knowledge about quality production, seed quality control and impurity identification. The process of categorising seeds has been traditionally done based on characteristics like colour, shape and texture. Generally, this is performed by specialists by visually inspecting each sample, which is a very tedious and time-consuming task. This procedure can be easily automated, providing a significantly more efficient method for seed sorting than having them be inspected using human labour. In related areas, computer vision technology based on machine learning (ML), symmetry and, more particularly, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been generously applied, often resulting in increased work efficiency. Considering the success of the computational intelligence methods in other image classification problems, this research proposes a classification system for seeds by employing CNN and transfer learning. The proposed system contains a model that classifies 14 commonly known seeds with the implication of advanced deep learning techniques. The techniques applied in this research include decayed learning rate, model checkpointing and hybrid weight adjustment. This research applies symmetry when sampling the images of the seeds during data formation. The application of symmetry generates homogeneity with regards to resizing and labelling the images to extract their features. This resulted in 99% classification accuracy during the training set. The proposed model produced results with an accuracy of 99% for the test set, which contained 234 images. These results were much higher than the results reported in related research.

CP  - 5th International Conference on Engineering, Applied Sciences and Technology (ICEAST)
AB  - Labor shortage is one of the most common yet critical problems in industrial sectors. Using robotics and automation to replace human labor is one of the most effective solutions. In this research, robotic technology is implemented in the trimming process which is one of the key steps in faucet manufacturing. The system is designed to be able to deal with uncertainties of the shape of flash that are occurred due to the impression-die forging process. A gripper with specific jaws is designed to suit the workpiece. A vision system is used to identify the position and orientation of the workpieces. As a result, with the gripper and the vision system, the workpieces can be grasped, transferred, and loaded into the trimming machine at high success rate in comparison to human labor. In this paper, the design procedure of the gripper and performance of the gripper are emphasized.

AB  - Deep learning-based pattern recognition has achieved impressive accuracy recently. In particular, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been successfully applied to solving various practical problems. One such problem is image-based product defect inspection. Product quality inspection is an essential step in a production line. So far, this task has been conducted primarily by human inspectors, but the inspection results are often affected by various human factors such as experience, health conditions, attention, and so on. CNN can be useful for reducing human factors and thus can be good for quality control. In practice, however, CNN-based defect detection is still a challenging task. One reason is that a single false negative (FN) error (i.e., classifying a defect as a normal case) may be a liability for a company, and this is the crucial difference between image recognition and defect detection. To reduce the FN error rate, in this study, we investigate the effect of "rejection" for defect detection. Experimental results demonstrate that a CNN ensemble with a proper rejection rate can have a very low FN error rate and can reduce human labor significantly.

TI  - Human Work Activity Recognition for Working Cells in Industrial Production Contexts
T2  - 2019 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SYSTEMS, MAN AND CYBERNETICS (SMC)
CP  - IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics (SMC)
AB  - Collaboration between robots and humans requires communicative skills on both sides. The robot has to understand the conscious and unconscious activities of human workers. Many state-of-the-art activity recognition algorithms with high performance rates on existing benchmark datasets are available for this task. This paper re-evaluates appropriate architectures in light of human work activity recognition for working cells in industrial production contexts. The specific constraints of such a domain is elaborated and used as prior knowledge. We utilize state-of-the-art algorithms as spatio-temporal feature encoders and search for appropriate classification and fusion strategies. Furthermore, we combine keypoint-based with appearance-based approaches to a multi-stream recognition system. Due to data protection rules and the high effort of data annotation within industrial domains only small datasets are available that reflect production aspects. Therefore, we use transfer learning approaches to reduce the dependency on data volume and variance in the target domain. The resulting recognition system achieves high performance for both singular person action and human-object interaction.

TI  - INTERACTIVE ROBOTICS TO AID PHYSICALLY DISABLED PEOPLE IN MANUFACTURING TASKS
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS PART B-JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING MANUFACTURE
AB  - Automation is commonly considered for application in manufacturing industry as a means of increasing productivity on repetitive assembly tasks.  Attempts to automate production processes fully have been hindered by the relatively slow development of suitable technology that is cost-effective in comparison with human labour.  It is known that automation is successful for high volume, rigidly structured tasks that require little decision-making.  It is not so successful in the less structured tasks where human decision-making plays an important role.  It is in manufacturing scenarios that rely on human decision-making that people with impaired motor function may use appropriate handling devices to carry out limited manual tasks within a more complex job activity.  Demographic changes are resulting in an ageing population, a shrinking labour force and, as a result, a need for industry to consider alternative sources of labour.  Most previous attempts to use robots in vocational rehabilitation have been made on an individual basis where a person possessing a desired skill becomes disabled and is able to continue in the job with robot assistance.  Since many people with severe physical disability from birth have a restricted primary and secondary education, it is unlikely that there will be widespread prospects in jobs such as computer programming or accounting.  This is not to say that computer-oriented jobs are not ideal for some disabled people, particularly those who have attained a high level of job qualification prior to becoming disabled.  The research described in this paper, however, aims to identify generic job activities that require human decision-making ability and that have a minimum of prerequisite educational qualifications.  This scenario is typical of many of the jobs within the manufacturing sector that allow the worker to acquire the necessary job skills through on-the-job training.

TI  - Window Cleaning System with Water Circulation for Building Facade Maintenance Robot and Its Efficiency Analysis
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRECISION ENGINEERING AND MANUFACTURING-GREEN TECHNOLOGY
AB  - Most maintenance works on building exterior walls are carried out by human labor and a cable-driven system (gondola). This approach involves a safety problem, motivating many recent studies of exterior wall automated maintenance methods. However; the conventional studies have been concentrated only on moving mechanism and the studies on cleaning method and processing of cleaning materials are insufficient. In addition, most conventional automated systems are composed of a roll-brush and injection nozzle. These systems generate problems such as the scattering and dripping of used water resulting contamination of surrounding areas. In order to solve these problems, a new cleaning tool system with water circulation function is developed to improve cleaning efficiency and reduce water usage in this paper Using the cleaning tool system with the water circulation (injection-squeeze-suction-collection-filtering-recharge) and Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) flow control, the scattering and dripping was removed and the water usage was reduced about 20%. Also, this cleaning tool system was compared to manual work by human experts as well as previously developed automated (or semi-automated) cleaning robots through statistical analysis.

TI  - Active Clustering with Model-Based Uncertainty Reduction
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB  - Semi-supervised clustering seeks to augment traditional clustering methods by incorporating side information provided via human expertise in order to increase the semantic meaningfulness of the resulting clusters. However, most current methods are passive in the sense that the side information is provided beforehand and selected randomly. This may require a large number of constraints, some of which could be redundant, unnecessary, or even detrimental to the clustering results. Thus in order to scale such semi-supervised algorithms to larger problems it is desirable to pursue an active clustering method-i.e., an algorithm that maximizes the effectiveness of the available human labor by only requesting human input where it will have the greatest impact. Here, we propose a novel online framework for active semi-supervised spectral clustering that selects pairwise constraints as clustering proceeds, based on the principle of uncertainty reduction. Using a first-order Taylor expansion, we decompose the expected uncertainty reduction problem into a gradient and a step-scale, computed via an application of matrix perturbation theory and cluster-assignment entropy, respectively. The resulting model is used to estimate the uncertainty reduction potential of each sample in the dataset. We then present the human user with pairwise queries with respect to only the best candidate sample. We evaluate our method using three different image datasets (faces, leaves and dogs), a set of common UCI machine learning datasets and a gene dataset. The results validate our decomposition formulation and show that our method is consistently superior to existing state-of-the-art techniques, as well as being robust to noise and to unknown numbers of clusters.

TI  - Machine Learning Assisted Citation Screening for Systematic Reviews
T2  - DIGITAL PERSONALIZED HEALTH AND MEDICINE
CP  - 30th Medical Informatics Europe (MIE) Conference
AB  - Evidence-based practice is highly dependent upon up-to-date systematic reviews (SR) for decision making. However, conducting and updating systematic reviews, especially the citation screening for identification of relevant studies, requires much human work and is therefore expensive. Automating citation screening using machine learning (ML) based approaches can reduce cost and labor. Machine learning has been applied to automate citation screening but not for the SRs with very narrow research questions. This paper reports the results and observations for an ongoing research that aims to automate citation screening for SRs with narrow research questions using machine learning. The research also sheds light on the problem of class imbalance and class overlap on the performance of ML classifiers when applied to SRs with narrow research questions.

AB  - From the beginning, human space flight expeditions have involved great risk and complexity. These flights, accordingly, have utilized substantial quantities of highly skilled human labor. Not surprisingly, human space fright has proven significantly more expensive than uncrewed missions. The rapid creation and evolution of increasingly powerful information technologies enabling design and development tools, schedulers, vehicle and system health monitoring capabilities, and autonomous systems - promise a new human-automation systems balance of work, a balance that holds the potential of greatly increased crewed and robotic space exploration capability with dramatically reduced costs. Information technology has now attained a level of sophistication such that further development must, from the outset, consider both the human and the machine as "components" of an integrated system, within which emphases vary depending upon the particular task or application. This paper examines the impact of information technologies, including such exemplar inherent human factors considerations as control of teleoperated systems and human/machine task allocation, within the context of a plausible lunar exploration program.

TI  - Automated Fraudulent Phone Call Recognition through Deep Learning
T2  - WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS & MOBILE COMPUTING
AB  - Several studies have shown that the phone number and call behavior generated by a phone call reveal the type of phone call. By analyzing the phone number rules and call behavior patterns, we can recognize the fraudulent phone call. The success of this recognition heavily depends on the particular set of features that are used to construct the classifier. Since these features are human-labor engineered, any change introduced to the telephone fraud can render these carefully constructed features ineffective. In this paper, we show that we can automate the feature engineering process and, thus, automatically recognize the fraudulent phone call by applying our proposed novel approach based on deep learning. We design and construct a new classifier based on Call Detail Records (CDR) for fraudulent phone call recognition and find that the performance achieved by our deep learning-based approach outperforms competing methods. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Specifically, in our accuracy evaluation, the obtained accuracy exceeds 99%, and the most performant deep learning model is 4.7% more accurate than the state-of-the-art recognition model on average. Furthermore, we show that our deep learning approach is very stable in real-world environments, and the implicit features automatically learned by our approach are far more resilient to dynamic changes of a fraudulent phone number and its call behavior over time. We conclude that the ability to automatically construct the most relevant phone number features and call behavior features and perform accurate fraudulent phone call recognition makes our deep learning-based approach a precise, efficient, and robust technique for fraudulent phone call recognition.

TI  - Proposed System for a Socio-Technical Design Framework for Improved User Collaborations with Automation Technologies
T2  - BEYOND INTERACTIONS, INTERACT 2019
CP  - 17th IFIP TC13 International Conference on Human-Computer Interaction (INTERACT)
AB  - To improve human performance, interactive technologies are going towards more automated systems that involve computers, robots and cyber-physical systems into the decision-making process. While automation can lead to increased performance and reduced impact of human errors, interactive technologies without optimal design can have a negative impact on the experience of operators and end-users, leading to suboptimal performance of the automated systems. In this research, we aim to evaluate and refine Human Work Interaction Design (HWID) framework to be applicable in various highly-automated settings including Industry 4.0 environments. This will be performed via a thorough literature review as the first step. The list of identified factors playing a potential role in various interactive systems will then be evaluated and optimised in three case studies. We will try to understand how to maximise collaborations between the users and the machine in interactive systems. A practical approach for evaluating both employees' and end-users' perspectives in three scenarios with different levels of automation will be assessed. We will evaluate the outputs in multiple levels of organisations, employees and end-users. The ultimate output of the study will be a framework or model that will help in designing future research studies for various automation scenarios, especially semi-autonomous systems that involve high levels of interaction between users and the machine. We will provide guide-lines for implementation of the proposed framework in different scenarios. We expect that the framework output of this research will provide a comprehensive guideline applicable to many Industry 4.0 technologies.

TI  - Fast Signals of Opportunity Fingerprint Database Maintenance with Autonomous Unmanned Ground Vehicle for Indoor Positioning
T2  - SENSORS
AB  - Indoor positioning technology based on Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) fingerprints is a potential navigation solution, which has the advantages of simple implementation, low cost and high precision. However, as the radio frequency signals can be easily affected by the environmental change during its transmission, it is quite necessary to build location fingerprint database in advance and update it frequently, thereby guaranteeing the positioning accuracy. At present, the fingerprint database building methods mainly include point collection and line acquisition, both of which are usually labor-intensive and time consuming, especially in a large map area. This paper proposes a fast and efficient location fingerprint database construction and updating method based on a self-developed Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) platform NAVIS, called Automatic Robot Line Collection. A smartphone was installed on NAVIS for collecting indoor Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) fingerprints of Signals of Opportunity (SOP), such as Bluetooth and Wi-Fi. Meanwhile, indoor map was created by 2D LiDAR-based Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) technology. The UGV automatically traverse the unknown indoor environment due to a pre-designed full-coverage path planning algorithm. Then, SOP sensors collect location fingerprints and generates grid map during the process of environment-traversing. Finally, location fingerprint database is built or updated by Kriging interpolation. Field tests were carried out to verify the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method. The results showed that, compared with the traditional point collection and line collection schemes, the root mean square error of the fingerprinting-based positioning results were reduced by 35.9% and 25.0% in static tests and 30.0% and 21.3% respectively in dynamic tests. Moreover, our UGV can traverse the indoor environment autonomously without human-labor on data acquisition, the efficiency of the automatic robot line collection scheme is 2.65 times and 1.72 times that of the traditional point collection and the traditional line acquisition, respectively.

TI  - Implementation of Technical and Technological Progress in Dairy Production
T2  - PROCESSES
AB  - The involvement of people and technical devices is a characteristic feature of technological processes in agriculture. Human access to modernized and more efficient technical equipment determines the differentiation of the proportions of the contributions of human labor and technical equipment to the implementation of production technology on farms. Taking into account the data on manual and machine work inputs, the methodology of determining the technological index level (T-L) was presented. The aim of the present study was to present the scope of use of the technological index level to assess the effects of technological progress in the dairy production system, with particular emphasis on cow milking. For the value range of the technological index level (0-100%), changes in the milkman's work efficiency were presented based on research carried out on farms equipped with milking equipment at different levels of technical advancement. Moreover, the course of changes in electricity and water consumption per liter of milk was determined in association with the technological index level. The issue of simultaneous implementation of various forms of progress was developed based on the example of milking cows with a milking robot. Five categories (ranges) of cows' milk yield were distinguished and compared with the current yields of cows in the European Union. On this basis, a discussion was initiated on the factors that facilitate and limit the implementation of technical and technological progress in dairy production.

AB  - Crowd-sourcing has become a popular means of acquiring labeled data for many tasks where humans are more accurate than computers, such as image tagging, entity resolution, and sentiment analysis. I lowever, due to the time and cost of human labor, solutions that rely solely on crowd-sourcing are often limited to small datasets (i.e., a few thousand items). This paper proposes algorithms for integrating machine learning into crowd-sourced databases in order to combine the accuracy of human labeling with the speed and costeffectiveness of machine learning classifiers. 1.3y using active learning as our optimization strategy for labeling tasks in crowd-sourced databases, we can minimize the number of questions asked to the crowd, allowing crowd-sourced applications to scale (i.e., label much larger datasets at lower costs).
   Designing active learning algorithms for a crowd-sourced database poses manypractical challenges: such algorithms need to be generic, scalable, and easy to use, even for practitioners who are not machine learning experts. We draw on the theory of nonparametric bootstrap to design, to the best of our knowledge, the first active learning algorithms that meet all these requirements.
   Our results, on 3 real-world datasets collected with Amazons Mechanical Turk, and on 15 UCI datasets, show that our methods on average ask 1-2 orders of magnitude fewer questions than the baseline, and 4.5-44x fewer than existing active learning algorithms.

TI  - A defect classification methodology for sewer image sets with convolutional neural networks
T2  - AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION
AB  - Sewer pipes are commonly inspected in situ with CCTV equipment. The CCTV footage is then reviewed by human operators in order to classify defects in the pipes and make a recommendation on possible interventions. This process is both labor-intensive and error-prone. Other researchers have suggested machine learning techniques to (partially) automate the human review of this footage, but the automated classifiers are often validated in artificial testing setups, leading to biased results that do not translate directly to operational impact. In this work, we discuss suitable evaluation metrics for this specific classification task - most notably 'specificity at sensitivity' and 'precision at recall' - and the importance of using a validation setup that includes a realistic ratio of images with defects to images without defects, and a sufficiently large dataset. We also introduce 'leavetwo-inspections-out' cross validation, designed to eliminate a data leakage bias that would otherwise cause an overestimation of classifier performance. We designed a convolutional neural network (CNN) and applied this validation methodology to automatically detect the twelve most common defect types in a dataset of over 2 million CCTV images. With this dataset and our validation methodology, our CNN outperforms the state-of-theart. Classification performance was highest for intruding and defective connections and lowest for porous pipes. While the CNN is not capable of fully automated classification at sufficient performance levels, we determined that if we augment the human operator with the CNN, this may reduce the required human labor by up to 60.5%.

TI  - Improving Chemical-induced Disease Relation Extraction with Learned Features Based on Convolutional Neural Network
T2  - 2017 9TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON KNOWLEDGE AND SYSTEMS ENGINEERING (KSE 2017)
CP  - 9th International Conference on Knowledge and Systems Engineering (KSE)
AB  - There have been an increasing number of various machine learning-based models successfully proposed and applied for automatic chemical-induced disease (CID) relation extraction. They, however, usually require carefully handcrafted rich feature sets, which rely on expert knowledge, thus require expensive human labor but normally still cannot generalize data well enough. In this paper, we propose a CID relation extraction model that learns features automatically through a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) instead of traditional handcrafted features. We exploit the shortest dependency path between a disease and a chemical for identifying their CID relation. Dependency relations, with and without their direction information, are further investigated. Experimental results on benchmark datasets (namely the BioCreative V dataset) are very potential, demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed model for CID relation extraction.

TI  - Design and evaluation of a slave manipulator with roll-pitch-roll wrist and automatic tool loading mechanism in telerobotic surgery
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ROBOTICS AND COMPUTER ASSISTED SURGERY
AB  - Background As there is a shortage of scrub nurses in many hospitals, automatic surgical tool exchanging mechanism without human labour has been studied. Minimally invasive robotic surgeries (MIRS) also require scrub nurses. A surgical tool loading mechanism without a scrub nurse's assistance for MIRS is proposed. Many researchers have developed minimally invasive surgical instruments with a wrist joint that can be movable inside the abdomen. However, implementation of a distal rolling joint on a gripper is rare. Methods To implement surgical tool exchanging without a scrub nurse's assistance, a slave manipulator and a tool loader were developed to load and unload a surgical tool unit. A surgical tool unit with a roll-pitch-roll wrist was developed. Several experiments were performed to validate the effectiveness of the slave manipulator and the surgical tool unit. Results The slave manipulator and the tool loader were able to successfully unload and load the surgical tool unit without human assistance. The total duration of unloading and loading the surgical tool unit was 97 s. Motion tracking experiments of the distal rolling joint were performed. The maximum positioning error of the step input response was 2 degrees. Conclusions The advantage of the proposed slave manipulator and tool loader is that other robotic systems or human labour are not needed for surgical tool loading. The feasibility of the distal rolling joint in MIS is verified. Copyright (C) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI  - An Intelligent Fault Diagnosis Method Using Unsupervised Feature Learning Towards Mechanical Big Data
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS
AB  - Intelligent fault diagnosis is a promising tool to deal with mechanical big data due to its ability in rapidly and efficiently processing collected signals and providing accurate diagnosis results. In traditional intelligent diagnosis methods, however, the features are manually extracted depending on prior knowledge and diagnostic expertise. Such processes take advantage of human ingenuity but are time-consuming and labor-intensive. Inspired by the idea of unsupervised feature learning that uses artificial intelligence techniques to learn features from raw data, a two-stage learning method is proposed for intelligent diagnosis of machines. In the first learning stage of the method, sparse filtering, an unsupervised two-layer neural network, is used to directly learn features from mechanical vibration signals. In the second stage, softmax regression is employed to classify the health conditions based on the learned features. The proposed method is validated by a motor bearing dataset and a locomotive bearing dataset, respectively. The results show that the proposed method obtains fairly high diagnosis accuracies and is superior to the existing methods for the motor bearing dataset. Because of learning features adaptively, the proposed method reduces the need of human labor and makes intelligent fault diagnosis handle big data more easily.

TI  - Networked mining of atomic and molecular data from electronic journal databases on the Internet
T2  - DATABASES IN NETWORKED INFORMATION SYSTEMS, PROCEEDINGS
CP  - 4th International Workshop on Databases in Networked Information Systems
AB  - Several centers of atomic and molecular data in the world maintain research databases for use in fusion plasma simulations, hadron therapy, modelling the universe and other areas. Among the data center activities, collection of experimental and theoretical results across the world has been of major importance. This includes the identification, relevance assessment and retrieval of journal articles, followed by the data extraction, data mining, format conversion and data input. The methodology of the process still largely relies on working groups of specialists and part-time human labor, in spite of recent modernization in journal publishing, especially the electronic journals newly available in subscription domain and the free-access online abstract databases. This work focuses on automating the above procedure to the maximum extent possible. In particular, we design a download robot that performs query search and abstract retrieval for the candidates of relevant articles over the internet at first stage,. followed by fultext retrieval (pdf format), text extraction and a deterministic relevance judgement. As a demonstration, we have also developed a bibliography database for electron-molecule collisions that automatically updates its contents over the internet in regular time intervals. The present work belongs to the project for evolutional data collecting system supported by a JSPS project which involves several research institutes.

TI  - Machine Health Monitoring with LSTM Networks
T2  - 2016 10TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SENSING TECHNOLOGY (ICST)
CP  - 10th International Conference on Sensing Technology (ICST)
AB  - Effective machine health monitoring systems are critical to modern manufacturing systems and industries. Among various machine health monitoring approaches, data-driven methods are gaining in popularity due to the development of advanced sensing and data analytic techniques. However, sensory data that is a kind of sequential data can not serve as direct meaningful representations for machine conditions due to its noise, varying length and irregular sampling. A majority of previous models focus on feature extraction/fusion methods that involve expensive human labor and high quality expert knowledge. With the development of deep learning methods in the last few years, representation learning from raw data has been redefined. Among deep learning models, Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs) are able to capture long-term dependencies and model sequential data. Therefore, LSTMs is able to work on the sensory data of machine condition. Here, the first study about a empirical evaluation of LSTMs-based machine health monitoring systems is presented. A real life tool wear test is introduced. Basic and deep LSTMs are designed to predict the actual tool wear based on raw sensory data. The experimental results have shown that our models, especially deep LSTMs, are able to outperform several state-of-arts baseline methods.

TI  - Abnormality Detecting Deep Belief Network
T2  - INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ADVANCES IN INFORMATION COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY & COMPUTING, 2016
CP  - International Conference on Advances in Information Communication Technology and Computing
AB  - Abnormality detection is useful in reducing the amount of data to be processed manually by directing attention to the specific portion of data. However, selections of suitable features are important for the success of an abnormality detection system. Designing and selecting appropriate features are time-consuming, requires expensive domain knowledge and human labor. Further, it is very challenging to represent high-level concepts of abnormality in terms of raw input. Most of the existing abnormality detection system use handcrafted feature detector and are based on shallow architecture.
   In this work, we explore Deep Belief Network for abnormality detection and simultaneously, compared the performance of classic neural network in terms of features learned and accuracy of detecting the abnormality. Further, we explore the set of features learn by each layer of the deep architecture. We also provide a simple and fast mechanism to visualize the feature at the higher layer. Further, the effect of different activation function on abnormality detection is also compared. We observed that deep learning based approach can be used for detecting an abnormality. It has better performance compare to classical neural network in separating distinct as well as almost similar data.

TI  - Scalable Similarity-Consistent Deep Metric Learning for Face Recognition
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
AB  - With the development of deep learning, deep metric learning (DML) has achieved great improvements in face recognition. Specifically, the widely used softmax losses in the training process often bring large intra-class variations, and feature normalization is only exploited in the testing process to compute the pair similarities. To bridge the gap, we impose the intra-class cosine similarity between the features and weight vectors in softmax loss larger than a margin in the training step and extend it from four aspects. First, we explore the effect of a hard sample mining strategy. To alleviate the human labor of adjusting the margin hyper-parameter, a self-adaptive margin updating strategy is proposed. Then, a normalized version is given to take full advantage of the cosine similarity constraint. Furthermore, we enhance the former constraints to consider the intra-class and inter-class constraints simultaneously in the exponential feature projection space. The extensive experiments on the labeled face in the wild (LFW), youtube faces (YTF), and IARPA Janus benchmark A (IJB-A) datasets demonstrate that the proposed methods outperform the mainstream DML methods and approach the state-of-the-art performance.

TI  - Semi-AI and Full-AI digitizer: The ways to digitalize visual field big data
T2  - COMPUTER METHODS AND PROGRAMS IN BIOMEDICINE
AB  - Background and objective: Glaucoma is one of the major diseases that cause blindness, which is incurable and irreversible, and it is essential to detect glaucoma vision deficits in treatment and check the progression of vision disorders in advance. In order to minimize the risk of glaucoma, it is necessary not only to diagnose and observe glaucoma but also to predict prognosis via indicators from Visual Field (VF) tests. However, information from the VF test cannot be directly used in clinical studies because most medical institutions store VF test sheets in Portable Document Format (PDF) or image files in different standards. Methods: We developed AI-based real-time VF big data digitizing systems that digitalize VF test images in real-time in two ways; Semi-AI and Full-AI digitizer. The Semi-AI digitizer detects the VF text area with actual coordinates derived from mouse handler system. Full-AI digitizer detects the VF text area with Faster Region Based Convolutional Neural Networks (RCNN). After detecting the text area, both systems extract texts with Recurrent Neural Network based Optical Character Recognition. Semi-AI and Full-AI digitizer post-processes the extracted text results with in-system algorithm and out-of-system algorithm, respectively. Results: Both systems used 325,310 VF test sheets from a tertiary hospital and extracted a total of 5,530,270 texts. From the 100 randomly selected VF sheets, 3,400 texts were used for the validation. Semi-AI and Full-AI digitizer showed 0.993 and 0.983 of accuracy, respectively. Conclusion: This study demonstrates the effectiveness of AI applications in detecting text areas and the different implementation methodologies of the post-processing process. In detecting text area, Semi-AI may be better than Full-AI digitizer in terms of system speed and human labor labeling if the number of types to be classified is small. However, Full-AI digitizer is recommended because it allows detecting text area regardless of resolution and size of the VF sheets, as the types of real-world VF test sheets cannot be predicted, and the types become more unpredictable when extended to multi-hospital studies. For Post-preprocessing, Semi-AI methodology is recommended because Semi-AI produced higher results with less effort and considered the convenience of researchers by implementing them as in-system.

TI  - Combining Rules and Proportions: A Multiobjective Approach to Algorithmic Composition
T2  - 2017 IEEE CONGRESS ON EVOLUTIONARY COMPUTATION (CEC)
CP  - IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC)
AB  - In recent times, several activities that lately were considered possible to do only by human work, have been replaced by the use of artificial intelligence. Recent researches have been developed to give computers a creativity ability as main objective. A type of related research is algorithmic composition. Traditionally evolutionary algorithms are successfully used for composing tasks, using a wide variety of fitness functions. This work presents a multiobjective approach that combines Fux's rules, from music theory, and functions that capture melodies' proportions, based on the Zipf's law, to compose monophonic melodies. Besides that, we propose a method that measures the amount of creativity contained in an algorithmic composition method. Experimental results show that the proposed methods have a good musical quality.

TI  - Adaptive Fisher-Based Deep Convolutional Neural Network and Its Application to Recognition of Rolling Element Bearing Fault Patterns and Sizes
T2  - MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING
AB  - Deep learning has the ability to mine complex relationships in fault diagnosis. Deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) with deep structures, instead of shallow ones, can be applied to mining useful information from the original vibration data. However, when the number of the training samples is small, the diagnosis accuracy will be affected. As an improvement of the DCNN, deep convolutional neural network based on the Fisher-criterion (FDCNN) can be used for the fault diagnosis of small samples. But the model parameters in the method are based on human labor or prior knowledge, which is bound to bring negative influence on the diagnosis accuracy. Therefore, a novel adaptive Fisher-based deep convolutional neural network (AFDCNN) method, which can optimize the model parameters adaptively, is proposed as an improvement of the FDCNN. Comparative verification test results show that AFDCNN has more outstanding performance.

AB  - With the increasing network topology complexity and continuous evolution of the new wireless technology, it is increasingly challenging to address the network service outage with traditional methods. In order to improve the network operation efficiency, a suitable machine learning technique is used to learn and classify individual base station into different issue based on multiple performance metrics during a specific time window. However an issue classification with supervised learning requires a large amount of labeled dataset, which takes costly human-labor and time to annotate data. To mitigate the cost and time issues, we propose a method based on few-shot learning that uses Prototypical Networks algorithm to complement the eNodeB states analysis. Using dataset from a live LTE network consists of thousand of eNodeB, our experiment results show that the proposed technique provides high performance while using a low number of labeled data.

T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE 5TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INVENTIVE COMPUTATION TECHNOLOGIES (ICICT-2020)
CP  - 5th International Conference on Inventive Computation Technologies (ICICT)
AB  - In countries like India road maintenance is a challenging task Year after year, the accident rates are increasing due to the up-surging potholes count. As the road maintenance process is done manually in most places, it consumes enormous time, requires human labor and subjected to human errors. Thus, there is a growing need for a cost-effective automated identification of potholes. In recent trends, many approaches proved good results in applying deep learning [1] for different object detection. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have the ability to learn the art of extracting relevant features from an Image. But in countries like India, there is no potholes dataset available to train the CNN. In this paper, a new 1500 image dataset has been created on Indian roads. The dataset is annotated and trained using YOLO (You Only Look Once). The new dataset is trained on YOLOv3, YOLOv2, YOLOv3-tiny, and the results are compared. The results are evaluated based on the mAP, precision and recall. The model is tested on different pothole images and it detects with a reasonable accuracy.

AB  - Chili is among top grown crops in Malaysia. Nevertheless, chili plant growth monitoring in Malaysia is still performed manually by human labor, which consumed lots of time, energy and the plant growth can only be monitored at site. Hence, this paper discussed the potential of deep learning algorithm in classifying chili plant growth images from a small dataset. The experiment is performed on 256 chili plant images that under various conditions, where the images were captured using a 12-megapixel and f/1.8 aperture camera. Experimented using ResNet-101 and ResNet-50 of Mask R-CNN models with 75% of the dataset for training and 25% for testing, the results showed that both models were able to detect the correct age of chili plants with accuracy of 96% for Mask R-CNN ResNe-50 which is lower than Mask R-CNN ResNe-101 by 1%.

TI  - CAT: computer aided triage improving upon the Bayes risk through epsilon-refusal triage rules
T2  - BMC BIOINFORMATICS
CP  - 3rd Computational Approaches for Cancer Wworkshop held at the SC Conference
AB  - BackgroundManual extraction of information from electronic pathology (epath) reports to populate the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Result (SEER) database is labor intensive. Systematizing the data extraction automatically using machine-learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) is desirable to reduce the human labor required to populate the SEER database and to improve the timeliness of the data. This enables scaling up registry efficiency and collection of new data elements. To ensure the integrity, quality, and continuity of the SEER data, the misclassification error of ML and NPL algorithms needs to be negligible. Current algorithms fail to achieve the precision of human experts who can bring additional information in their assessments. Differences in registry format and the desire to develop a common information extraction platform further complicate the ML/NLP tasks. The purpose of our study is to develop triage rules to partially automate registry workflow to improve the precision of the auto-extracted information.ResultsThis paper presents a mathematical framework to improve the precision of a classifier beyond that of the Bayes classifier by selectively classifying item that are most likely to be correct. This results in a triage rule that only classifies a subset of the item. We characterize the optimal triage rule and demonstrate its usefulness in the problem of classifying cancer site from electronic pathology reports to achieve a desired precision.ConclusionsFrom the mathematical formalism, we propose a heuristic estimate for triage rule based on post-processing the soft-max output from standard machine learning algorithms. We show, in test cases, that the triage rule significantly improve the classification accuracy.

TI  - Learning the Human Judgment for the Automatic Evaluation of Chatbot
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE 12TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON LANGUAGE RESOURCES AND EVALUATION (LREC 2020)
CP  - 12th International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC)
AB  - It is hard to evaluate the quality of the generated text by a generative dialogue system. Currently, dialogue evaluation relies on human judges to label the quality of the generated text. It is not a reusable mechanism that can give consistent evaluation for system developers. We believe that it is easier to get consistent results on comparing two generated dialogue by two systems and it is hard to give a consistent quality score on only one system at a time. In this paper, we propose a machine learning approach to reduce the effort of human evaluation by learning the human judgment on comparing two dialogue systems. Training from the human labeling result, the evaluation model learns which generative models is better in each dialog context. Thus, it can be used for system developers to compare the fine-tuned models over and over again without the human labor. In our experiment we find the agreement between the learned model and human judge is 70%. The experiment is conducted on comparing two attention based GRU-RNN generative models.

TI  - A Method of Automatic Feature Extraction from Massive Vibration Signals of Machines
T2  - 2016 IEEE INTERNATIONAL INSTRUMENTATION AND MEASUREMENT TECHNOLOGY CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS
CP  - IEEE International Instrumentation and Measurement Technology Conference (I2MTC)
AB  - In the studies of intelligent fault diagnosis of machines, lots of effort goes into designing effective feature extraction algorithms. Such processes would consume plenty of human labor, especially when dealing with massive vibration signals. So it is interesting to automatically extract features using machine learning techniques, instead of manually extracting them. To deal with the problem, this paper presents a new automatic feature extraction method of machines. The proposed method first learns features from the vibration signals by K-means, and then maps the learned features into a salient low-dimensional feature space using t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE). Through the feature extraction results of a bearing dataset, it is verified that the proposed method is able to effectively learn the features from the raw vibration signals and is superior to the manual features like time-domain features and wavelet features. Therefore, the proposed method has potential to be a tool in the automatic data mining of intelligent fault diagnosis.

TI  - Controlling Long-Distance Photoactuation with Protein Additives
T2  - SMALL
AB  - Long-distance wireless actuation indicates precise remote control over materials, sensors, and devices that are widely utilized in biomedical, defence, disaster relief, deep ocean, and outer space applications to replace human work. Unlike radio frequency (RF) control, which has low tolerance toward electromagnetic interference (EMI), light control represents a promising method to overcome EMI. Nonetheless, long-distance light-controlled wireless actuation able to compete with RF control has not been achieved until now due to the lack of highly light-sensitive actuator designs. Here, it is demonstrate that amyloid-like protein aggregates can organize photomodule single-layer reduced graphene oxide (rGO) into a well-defined multilayer stack to display long-distance photoactuation. The amyloid-like proteinaceous component docks the rGO layers together to form a hybrid film, which can reliably adhere onto various material surfaces with robust interfacial adhesion. The sensitive photothermal effect and a fast bending in 1 s to switch a circuit are achieved after forming the film on a plastic substrate and irradiating the bilayer film with a blue laser from 100 m away. A photoactuation distance of 50 km can be further extrapolated based on a commercial high-power laser. This study reveals the great potential of amyloid-like aggregates in remote light control of robots and devices.

TI  - TumorGAN: A Multi-Modal Data Augmentation Framework for Brain Tumor Segmentation
T2  - SENSORS
AB  - The high human labor demand involved in collecting paired medical imaging data severely impedes the application of deep learning methods to medical image processing tasks such as tumor segmentation. The situation is further worsened when collecting multi-modal image pairs. However, this issue can be resolved through the help of generative adversarial networks, which can be used to generate realistic images. In this work, we propose a novel framework, named TumorGAN, to generate image segmentation pairs based on unpaired adversarial training. To improve the quality of the generated images, we introduce a regional perceptual loss to enhance the performance of the discriminator. We also develop a regionalL1loss to constrain the color of the imaged brain tissue. Finally, we verify the performance of TumorGAN on a public brain tumor data set, BraTS 2017. The experimental results demonstrate that the synthetic data pairs generated by our proposed method can practically improve tumor segmentation performance when applied to segmentation network training.

TI  - Real-Time System for Automatic Cold Strip Surface Defect Detection
T2  - FME TRANSACTIONS
AB  - Detection and classification of surface defects of the rolled metal are one of the main tasks for correctly assessing product quality. Historically, these tasks were performed by a human. However, due to a multitude of production factors, such as high rolling rate and temperature of the metal, the results of such human work are rather low. Replacing a human controller with an artificial intelligence system has been relevant for a long time; it is merely necessary within the concept of Industry 4.0.
   This paper is devoted to the development of the prototype system automatic detection and classification of defects for one of the Iron-and-Steel Works of the Chelyabinsk region in the Russian Federation. The prototype consists of the Preprocessor, Classifier, Server, Database, and User interface. The main focus is on achieving high classification accuracy, which is planned to be obtained through the use of convolutional neural networks.

TI  - Deep Transfer Learning for Automated Intestinal Bleeding Detection in Capsule Endoscopy Imaging
T2  - JOURNAL OF DIGITAL IMAGING
AB  - Purpose: The objective of this paper was to develop a computer-aided diagnostic (CAD) tools for automated analysis of capsule endoscopic (CE) images, more precisely, detect small intestinal abnormalities like bleeding. Methods: In particular, we explore a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based deep learning framework to identify bleeding and non-bleeding CE images, where a pre-trained AlexNet neural network is used to train a transfer learning CNN that carries out the identification. Moreover, bleeding zones in a bleeding-identified image are also delineated using deep learning-based semantic segmentation that leverages a SegNet deep neural network. Results: To evaluate the performance of the proposed framework, we carry out experiments on two publicly available clinical datasets and achieve a 98.49% and 88.39% F1 score, respectively, on the capsule endoscopy.org and KID datasets. For bleeding zone identification, 94.42% global accuracy and 90.69% weighted intersection over union (IoU) are achieved. Conclusion: Finally, our performance results are compared to other recently developed state-of-the-art methods, and consistent performance advances are demonstrated in terms of performance measures for bleeding image and bleeding zone detection. Relative to the present and established practice of manual inspection and annotation of CE images by a physician, our framework enables considerable annotation time and human labor savings in bleeding detection in CE images, while providing the additional benefits of bleeding zone delineation and increased detection accuracy. Moreover, the overall cost of CE enabled by our framework will also be much lower due to the reduction of manual labor, which can make CE affordable for a larger population.

TI  - Design and evaluation of a modular robotic plum harvesting system utilizing soft components
T2  - JOURNAL OF FIELD ROBOTICS
AB  - The human labor required for tree crop harvesting is a major cost component in fruit production and is increasing. To address this, many existing research works have sought to demonstrate commercially viable robotic harvesting for tree crops, though successful commercial products resulting from these have been few and far between. Systems developed for specific crops such as sweet peppers or apples have shown promise, but the vast majority of cultivar types remain unaddressed, and developing a specific system for each one is inefficient. In this study, an easily modifiable development platform for robotic fruit harvesting is presented, this can be used to test specific design choices on different fruit and growing conditions. The system is evaluated in a commercial plum orchard, with no crop modifications. Both a hard and soft gripper are trialed, along with three object detector approaches and two picking motions. Some existing techniques are found to be counterproductive for plums, while soft robotics and persistent target tracking significantly improve performance. The best harvest success rate of 42%, was observed when using the soft gripper with complex motion. This is lower than expected based on prior testing with apples and indicates the difficulty in moving to new fruit types. Unique challenges specific to the plum type and growing style are examined in the context of system module design choices.

TI  - Automation of the ACR MRI Low-Contrast Resolution Test Using Machine Learning
T2  - 2018 11TH INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS ON IMAGE AND SIGNAL PROCESSING, BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING AND INFORMATICS (CISP-BMEI 2018)
CP  - 11th International Congress on Image and Signal Processing, BioMedical Engineering and Informatics (CISP-BMEI)
AB  - Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a powerful, widespread and indispensable medical imaging modality. The American College of Radiology (ACR) recommends weekly acquisition of phantom images to assess the quality of scanner. Usually, these images must be analyzed by experienced technicians. Automatic analysis of these images would reduce costs and improve repeatability. Some automated methods have been proposed, but the automation of two of the ACR image quality tests remains open problem. Reports on the high-and low-contrast resolution tests are scarce and so far none of the proposed methods produce results robust enough to allow replacing human work. We use Machine Learning to emulate, with high accuracy, the detection of 120 low-contrast structures of ACR phantom by an experienced professional. We used a database with 620 sets of ACR phantom images that were acquired on scanners of different vendors, fields and coils, totaling 74,400 low-contrast structures. Technicians with more than 10 years of experience labeled each structure as 'detectable' or 'undetectable'. Machine learning algorithms were fed with image features extracted from the structures and their surroundings. Among the five methods we tested, Logistic Regression yielded the largest area under the ROC curve (0.878) and the highest Krippendorff's alpha (0.995). The results achieved in this study are substantially better than those previously reported in the literature. They are also better than the classifications made by junior technicians (with less than 5 years of experience). This indicate that the ACR MRI low-contrast resolution test may be automated using Machine Learning.

T2  - 2017 IEEE 26TH INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS (ISIE)
CP  - 26th IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics (ISIE)
AB  - The main motivation to develop this work is to create a diagnosis system able to facilitate the work of human experts responsible for detecting faults before acquisition of submersible petroleum motor pump systems. A new approach for multiclass learning by reduction to multiple, binary classifiers, in a one-versus-one scheme, is presented as an alternative artificial intelligence solution to diagnose faults. Such an idea is based on the hypothesis that each pair of process conditions has different optimal feature sets to improve the classification performance. Thus, features are selected from datasets containing only two classes. Then, classifiers are trained with the selected features. The combination uses the average confidence of each classifier pair prediction to calculate the ensemble answer. Experimental results show that the proposed approach improves classification performance in a statistically significant way, when compared with correlated work. A secondary contribution is the analysis of the most difficult fault to be identified, namely rubbing.

TI  - Combining Deep Learning Methods and Human Knowledge to Identify Anomalies in Computed Tomography (CT) Reports
T2  - MEDICAL IMAGING 2019: COMPUTER-AIDED DIAGNOSIS
CP  - Conference on Medical Imaging - Computer-Aided Diagnosis
AB  - Many researchers in the field of machine learning have addressed the problem of detecting anomalies within Computed Tomography (CT) scans. Training these machine learning algorithms requires a dataset of CT scans with identified anomalies (labels), usually, in specific organs. This represents a problem, since it requires experts to review thousands of images in order to create labels for these data. We aim to decrease human burden at labeling CT scans by developing a model that identifies anomalies within plain-text-based reports that then could be further used as a method to create labels for models based on CT scans. This study contains more than 4800 CT reports from Duke Health System, for which we aim to identify organ specific abnormalities. We propose an iterative active learning approach that consists of building a machine learning model to classify CT reports by abnormalities in different organs and then improving it by actively adding reports sequentially. At each iteration, clinical experts review the report that provides the model with highest expected information gain. This process is done in real time by using a web interface. Then, this datum is used by the model to improve its performance. We evaluated the performance of our method for abnormalities in kidneys and lungs. When starting with a model trained on 99 reports, the results show the model achieves an Area Under the Curve (AUC) score of 0.93 on the test set after adding 130 actively labeled reports to the model from an unlabeled pool of 4,000. This suggests that a set of labeled CT scans can be obtained with significantly reduced human work by combining machine learning techniques and clinical experts' knowledge.

Recently, AI technology is widely used to alleviate human labor burden. Can machine learn from human to review papers automatically? In this paper, we propose a collaborative grammar and innovation model - DeepReviewer to achieve automatic paper review. This model learning the semantic, grammar and innovative features of an article by three main well designed components simultaneously. Moreover, these three factors are integrated by an attention layer to get the final review score of the paper. We crawled paper review data from Openreview and built a real data set. Experimental results demonstrate that our model exceeds many baselines.

TI  - Automatic problem extraction and analysis from unstructured text in IT tickets
T2  - IBM JOURNAL OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
AB  - IT services are extremely human labor intensive, and a key focus is to provide efficient services at low cost. Automation of repeatable IT tasks using software service agents that reduce human effort is therefore an important component of service management. A large fraction of the work done by IT service personnel involves troubleshooting of problems. However, the complexity of IT systems makes automated problem determination and resolution a challenging research problem. Using a database of prior customer problems and solutions, we build a system that extracts knowledge about different classes of problems arising in the IT infrastructure, mine problem linkages to recent system changes, and identify the resolution activities to mitigate problems. The system, at its core, uses data mining, machine learning, and natural language parsing techniques. By using extracted knowledge, one can (i) understand the kind of problems and the root causes affecting the IT infrastructure, (ii) proactively remediate the causes so that they no longer result in problems, and (iii) estimate the scope for automation for service management. In the future, a large cost differentiator for any IT company will often involve being able to build automated service agents from these technologies, which will result in a reduction in human effort.

TI  - Unsupervised feature analysis with sparse adaptive learning
T2  - PATTERN RECOGNITION LETTERS
AB  - Unsupervised feature learning has played an important role in machine learning due to its ability to save human labor cost. Since the absence of labels in such scenario, a commonly used approach is to select features according to the similarity matrix derived from the original feature space. However, their similarity matrices suffer from noises and redundant features, with which are frequently confronted in high-dimensional data. In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised feature selection algorithm. Compared with the previous works, there are mainly two merits of the proposed algorithm: (1) The similarity matrix is adaptively adjusted with a comprehensive strategy to fully utilize the information in the projected data and the original data. (2) To guarantee the clarity of the dramatically learned manifold structure, a non-squared l(2)-norm based sparsity method is imposed into the objective function. The proposed objective function involves several non-smooth constraints, making it difficult to solve. We also design an efficient iterative algorithm to optimize it. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms on several kinds of publicly available datasets. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Joint model for residual life estimation based on Long-Short Term Memory network
T2  - NEUROCOMPUTING
AB  - With the rapid development of industrial internet of things, multi-sensor technology has been widely used in system condition monitoring and residual useful life (RUL) estimation, which plays a crucial role in preventing catastrophic failures and reducing maintenance losses. However, current prognosis using multi-sensor data faces the following challenges: (i) Manual feature selection and extraction and exploration of degradation failure mechanism for a complex domain require a substantial amount of human labor and expertise from the practitioner, which is seldom available. (ii) Data fusion and prognosis are usually divided into two separate steps, resulting in the lack of intrinsic relationship between the two tasks. (iii) The end-to-end prediction methods directly based on deep learning behave like the black-box and provide no information for degradation progression. To overcome these drawbacks, a prediction framework comprising two deep learning models is proposed in this paper. Through the proposed supervised joint training scheme, the framework not only provides a continuous visualization progression of system degradation but also ensures that the generated fusion signal effectively performs in RUL prediction. As a framework application, a joint model of RUL estimation based on an ordinary long short-term memory network is designed. In the experiment section, a simulation study is firstly performed to show its RUL prediction performance. Then, a case study is conducted using two public experimental data sets (the aircraft turbofan engine data and the milling). Furthermore, the advantage of the proposed joint model is validated by carrying out a comparison with other methods based on the same experimental data sets. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Big Data Framework for Rail Inspection
T2  - 2017 INTERNATIONAL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND DATA PROCESSING SYMPOSIUM (IDAP)
CP  - 2017 International Artificial Intelligence and Data Processing Symposium (IDAP)
AB  - It is necessary that periodical inspection and maintenance of railway transportation systems, which is becoming more and more common day by day, is required.
   A typical rail line can range from a few kilometers to thousands of kilometers. It is not possible to control this length of railway line with human labor. For this purpose, rail inspection is done automatically by machine vision today. The input data of machine vision systems consists of data from high-resolution cameras and other sensors. These data are evaluated by machine learning methods and the diagnosis result is produced. However, the data rate and the amount of data that occur in both long-distance and long-time repetitive ray inspection applications are huge. Proper handling, storage and analysis of this data requires a Big Data-based approach.
   In this study, an approach is proposed for the evaluation of large data obtained from vision-based diagnostic systems and the extraction of useful information in tracked systems. The proposed approach has been verified using simulation and experimental data and the effectiveness of the approach, utility, usability, and other visual-based diagnostic approaches to be developed in directed systems have been demonstrated.

TI  - Performance Analysis of Deep Learning CNN Models for Variety Classification in Hazelnut
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - In evaluating agricultural products, knowing the specific product varieties is important for the producer, the industrialist, and the consumer. Human labor is widely used in the classification of varieties. It is generally performed by visual examination of each sample by experts, which is very laborious and time-consuming with poor sensitivity. There is a need in commercial hazelnut production for a rapid, non-destructive and reliable variety classification in order to obtain quality nuts from the orchard to the consumer. In this study, a convolutional neural network, which is one of the deep learning methods, was preferred due to its success in computer vision. A total of 17 widely grown hazelnut varieties were classified. The proposed model was evaluated by comparing with pre-trained models. Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-Score evaluation metrics were used to determine the performance of classifiers. It was found that the proposed model showed a better performance than pre-trained models in terms of performance evaluation criteria. The proposed model was found to produce 98.63% accuracy in the test set, including 510 images. This result has shown that the proposed model can be used practically in the classification of hazelnut varieties.

TI  - Counting trees with point-wise supervised segmentation network
T2  - ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
AB  - Tree counting plays an important role in wide applications of environmental protection, agricultural planning and crop yield estimation. However, traditional tree counting methods require expensive feature engineering, which causes additional mistake and cannot be optimized overall. Recently, deep learning based approaches have been adopted for this task which demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. In this paper, a point wise supervised segmentation network is proposed based on a deep segmentation network with only weak supervision, which can complete localization and generate mask of each tree simultaneously. In the first step, a tree feature extractor module is adopted to extract features of input images with a novel encoder?decoder network. In the second step, an effective strategy is designed to deal with different conditions with mask predictions. Finally, the basic localization and rectification guidance are introduced to train the whole network. In addition, two different datasets are created and an existing challenging plant dataset is selected to evaluate the proposed method. Experimental results on those datasets show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in most challenging conditions. This method has great potential to reduce human labor due to effective automatic generated masks.

TI  - Input Use Efficiency Management for Paddy Production Systems in India: A Machine Learning Approach
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
AB  - This research illustrates the technical efficiency of the pan-India paddy cultivation status obtained through a stochastic frontier approach. The results suggest that the mean technical efficiency varies from 0.64 in Gujarat to 0.95 in Odisha. Inputs like human labor, mechanical labor, fertilizer, irrigation and insecticide were found to determine the yield in paddy cultivation across India (except for Chhattisgarh). Inefficiency in the paddy production in Punjab, Bihar, West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Assam, Gujarat and Odisha in 2016-2017 was caused by technical inefficiency due to poor input management, as suggested by the significant sigma U-2 and sigma(2)v values of the stochastic frontier model. In addition, most of the farm groups in the study operated in the high-efficiency group (80-90% technical efficiency). No specific pattern of input use can be visualized through descriptive measures to give any specific policy implication. Thus, machine learning algorithms based on the input parameters were tested on the data in order to predict the farmers' efficiency class for individual states. The highest mean accuracy of 0.80 for the models of all of the states was achieved in random forest models. Among the various states of India, the best random forest prediction model based on accuracy was fitted to the input data of Bihar (0.91), followed by Uttar Pradesh (0.89), Andhra Pradesh (0.88), Assam (0.88) and West Bengal (0.86). Thus, the study provides a technique for the classification and prediction of a farmer's efficiency group from the levels of input use in paddy cultivation for each state in the study. The study uses the DES input dataset to classify and predict the efficiency group of the farmer, as other machine learning models in agriculture have used mostly satellite, spectral imaging and soil property data to detect disease, weeds and crops.

TI  - NetCalib: A Novel Approach for LiDAR-Camera Auto-calibration Based on Deep Learning
T2  - 2020 25TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON PATTERN RECOGNITION (ICPR)
CP  - 25th International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR)
AB  - A fusion of LiDAR and cameras have been widely used in many robotics applications such as classification, segmentation, object detection, and autonomous driving. It is essential that the LiDAR sensor can measure distances accurately, which is a good complement to the cameras. Hence, calibrating sensors before deployment is a mandatory step. The conventional methods include checkerboards, specific patterns, or human labeling, which is trivial and human-labor extensive if we do the same calibration process every time. The main purpose of this research work is to build a deep neural network that is capable of automatically finding the geometric transformation between LiDAR and cameras. The results show that our model manages to find the transformations from randomly sampled artificial errors. Besides, our work is open-sourced for the community to fully utilize the advances of the methodology for developing more the approach, initiating collaboration, and innovation in the topic.

TI  - Robotic architectural assembly with tactile skills: Simulation and optimization
T2  - AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION
AB  - Construction is an industry that could benefit significantly from automation, yet still relies heavily on manual human labor. Thus, we investigate how a robotic arm can be used to assemble a structure from predefined discrete building blocks autonomously. Since assembling structures is a challenging task that involves complex contact dynamics, we propose to use a combination of reinforcement learning and planning for this task. In this work, we take a first step towards autonomous construction by training a controller to place a single building block in simulation. Our evaluations show that trial-and-error algorithms that have minimal prior knowledge about the problem to be solved, so called model-free deep reinforcement learning algorithms, can be successfully employed. We conclude that the achieved results, albeit imperfect, serve as a proof of concept and indicate the directions for further research to enable more complex assemblies involving multiple building elements.

TI  - Entity Resolution with Recursive Blocking
T2  - BIG DATA RESEARCH
AB  - Entity resolution is a well-known challenge in data management for the lack of unique identifiers of records and various errors hidden in the data, undermining the identifiability of entities they refer to. To reveal matching records, every record potentially needs to be compared with all other records in the database, which is computationally intractable even for moderately-sized databases. To circumvent this quadratic challenge, blocking methods are typically employed to facilitate restricting promising comparisons of pairs within small subsets, called blocks, of records. Existing effective methods typically rely on blocking keys created by experts to capture matches, which inevitably involves a large amount of human labor and do not guarantee high-quality results. To reduce manual labor and promote accuracy, machine learning approaches are investigated to meet the challenge with limited success, due to high requirements of training data and inefficiency, especially for large databases. The exhaustive method produces exact results but suffers from efficiency problems. In this paper, we propose a paradigm of divide-and-conquer entity resolution, named recursive blocking, which derives comparatively good results while largely alleviating efficiency concerns. Specifically, recursive blocking refines blocks and traps matches in an iterative fashion to derive high-quality results, and we study two types of recursive blocking, i.e. redundancy- and partition-based approaches, and investigate their relative performance. Comprehensive experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets verified the superiority of our approaches over the existing ones. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Prediction of Soybean Plant Density Using a Machine Learning Model and Vegetation Indices Extracted from RGB Images Taken with a UAV
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
AB  - Soybean plant density is an important factor of successful agricultural production. Due to the high number of plants per unit area, early plant overlapping and eventual plant loss, the estimation of soybean plant density in the later stages of development should enable the determination of the final plant number and reflect the state of the harvest. In order to assess soybean plant density in a digital, nondestructive, and less intense way, analysis was performed on RGB images (containing three channels: RED, GREEN, and BLUE) taken with a UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) on 66 experimental plots in 2018, and 200 experimental plots in 2019. Mean values of the R, G, and B channels were extracted for each plot, then vegetation indices (VIs) were calculated and used as predictors for the machine learning model (MLM). The model was calibrated in 2018 and validated in 2019. For validation purposes, the predicted values for the 200 experimental plots were compared with the real number of plants per unit area (m(2)). Model validation resulted in the correlation coefficient-R = 0.87, mean absolute error (MAE) = 6.24, and root mean square error (RMSE) = 7.47. The results of the research indicate the possibility of using the MLM, based on simple values of VIs, for the prediction of plant density in agriculture without using human labor.

TI  - Intelligent Bearing Fault Diagnosis Method Combining Compressed Data Acquisition and Deep Learning
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INSTRUMENTATION AND MEASUREMENT
AB  - Effective intelligent fault diagnosis has long been a research focus on the condition monitoring of rotary machinery systems. Traditionally, time-domain vibration-based fault diagnosis has some deficiencies, such as complex computation of feature vectors, excessive dependence on prior knowledge and diagnostic expertise, and limited capacity for learning complex relationships in fault signals. Furthermore, following the increase in condition data, how to promptly process the massive fault data and automatically provide accurate diagnosis has become an urgent need to solve. Inspired by the idea of compressed sensing and deep learning, a novel intelligent diagnosis method is proposed for fault identification of rotating machines. In this paper, a nonlinear projection is applied to achieve the compressed acquisition, which not only reduces the amount of measured data that contained all the information of faults but also realizes the automatic feature extraction in transform domain. For exploring the discrimination hidden in the acquired data, a stacked sparse autoencoders-based deep neural network is established and performed with an unsupervised learning procedure followed by a supervised fine-tuning process. We studied the significance of compressed acquisition and provided the effects of key factors and comparison with traditional methods. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated using data sets from rolling element bearings and the analysis shows that it is able to obtain high diagnotic accuracies and is superior to the existing methods. The proposed method reduces the need of human labor and expertise and provides new strategy to handle the massive data more easily.

TI  - Microcontroller Based Sampling and Reagent Arm used for Batch Analyzer
T2  - CHEMICAL, CIVIL AND MECHANICAL ENGINEERING TRACKS OF 3RD NIRMA UNIVERSITY INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ENGINEERING (NUICONE2012)
CP  - 3rd Nirma-University International Conference on Engineering (NUiCONE)
AB  - In today's scenario, automation is being given high priorities as it requires less human labour and is faster. With this in context, a clinical batch analyzer can be automated to perform various tests with a higher accuracy and efficiency. Generally, a patient sample is reacted with proportionate amount of reagent in a reaction cell to perform a required test and then a new setup is used for next test. So a design with three robotics arms and a batch analyzer plate can be used to perform the mentioned operation. The two of the three arms will be operating for transferring the samples to the reaction cell present in the batch plate and the third for ensuring the mixing of the fluids with each other and transferring the content to the micro flow cell where the test results can be readout. This automation of the batch analyzer will reduce the amount of time taken to complete the entire process but also increase the efficiency of test results. The system proposed can be used to perform 38 different types of tests for 32 different patients. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Acoustic chord transcription and key extraction from audio using key-dependent HMMs trained on synthesized audio
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUDIO SPEECH AND LANGUAGE PROCESSING
AB  - We describe an acoustic chord transcription system that uses symbolic data to train hidden Markov models and gives best-of-class frame-level recognition results. We avoid the extremely laborious task of human annotation of chord names and boundaries-which must be done to provide machine learning models with ground truth-by performing automatic harmony analysis on symbolic music files. In parallel, we synthesize audio from the same symbolic files and extract acoustic feature vectors which are in perfect alignment with the labels. We, therefore, generate a large set of labeled training data with a minimal amount of human labor. This allows for richer models. Thus, we build 24 key-dependent HMMs, one for each key, using the key information derived from symbolic data. Each key model defines a unique state-transition characteristic and helps avoid confusions seen in the observation vector. Given acoustic input, we identify a musical key by choosing a key model with the maximum likelihood, and we obtain the chord sequence from the optimal state path of the corresponding key model, both of which are returned by a Viterbi decoder. This not only increases the chord recognition accuracy, but also gives key information. Experimental results show the models trained on synthesized data perform very well on real recordings, even though the labels automatically generated from symbolic data are not 100% accurate. We also demonstrate the robustness of the tonal centroid feature, which outperforms the conventional chroma feature.

TI  - Point in: Counting Trees with Weakly Supervised Segmentation Network
T2  - 2020 25TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON PATTERN RECOGNITION (ICPR)
CP  - 25th International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR)
AB  - For tree counting tasks, since traditional image processing methods require expensive feature engineering and are not end-to-end frameworks, this will cause additional noise and cannot be optimized overall, so this method has not been widely used in recent trends of tree counting application. Recently, many deep learning based approaches are designed for this task because of the powerful feature extracting ability. The representative way is bounding box based supervised method, but time-consuming annotations are indispensable for them. Moreover, these methods are difficult to overcome the occlusion or overlap. To solve this problem, we propose a weakly tree counting network (WTCNet) based on deep segmentation network with only point supervision. It can simultaneously complete tree counting with localization and output mask of each tree at the same time. We first adopt a novel feature extractor network (FENet) to get features of input images, and then an effective strategy is introduced to deal with different mask predictions. In the end, we propose a basic localization guidance accompany with rectification guidance to train the network. We create two different datasets and select an existing challenging plant dataset to evaluate our method on three different tasks. Experimental results show the good performance improvement of our method compared with other existing methods. Further study shows that our method has great potential to reduce human labor and provide effective groundtruth masks and the results show the superiority of our method over the advanced methods.

TI  - Few-Shot Learning and Self-Training for eNodeB Log Analysis for Service-Level Assurance in LTE Networks
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NETWORK AND SERVICE MANAGEMENT
AB  - With the increasing network topology complexity and continuous evolution of the new wireless technology, it is challenging to address the network service outage with traditional methods. In the long-term evolution (LTE) networks, a large number of base stations called eNodeBs are deployed to cover the entire service areas spanning various kinds of geographical regions. Each eNodeB generates a large number of key performance indicators (KPIs). Hundreds of thousands of eNodeBs are typically deployed to cover a nation-wide service area. Operators need to handle hundreds of millions of KPIs to cover the areas. It is impractical to handle manually such a huge amount of KPI data, and automation of data processing is therefore desired. To improve network operation efficiency, a suitable machine learning technique is used to learn and classify individual eNodeBs into different states based on multiple performance metrics during a specific time window. However, an issue with supervised learning requires a large amount of labeled dataset, which takes costly human-labor and time to annotate data. To mitigate the cost and time issues, we propose a method based on few-shot learning that uses Prototypical Networks algorithm to complement the eNodeB states analysis. Using a dataset from a live LTE network that consists of thousand of eNodeB, our experiment results show that the proposed technique provides high performance while using a low number of labeled data.

TI  - A fault diagnosis scheme for rotating machinery using hierarchical symbolic analysis and convolutional neural network
T2  - ISA TRANSACTIONS
AB  - Fault diagnosis of rotating machinery is crucial to improve safety, enhance reliability and reduce maintenance cost. The manual feature extraction and selection of traditional fault diagnosis methods depend on signal processing skills and expert experience, which is labor-intensive and time-consuming. As a typical intelligent fault diagnosis method, the convolutional neural network automatically learns features from original data, but it is extremely difficult to design and train a deep network architecture. This paper proposes a fault diagnosis scheme combined of hierarchical symbolic analysis (HSA) and convolutional neural network (CNN), which achieves laborsaving and timesaving preliminary feature extraction and accomplishes automatically feature learning with simplified network architecture. Firstly, hierarchical symbolic analysis is employed to extract features from original signals. The extracted features are able to identify different health conditions under various operating conditions. Then, convolutional neural network instead of human labor is used to learn the complex non-linear relationship between features and health conditions automatically. The architecture of CNN diagnosis model is simple and convenient to implement. Finally, a centrifugal pump dataset and a motor bearing dataset are adopted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The diagnosis results show that the proposed method exhibits superior performance compared with shallow methods and deep learning methods. (C) 2019 ISA. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

This study is comparing the imputation method of missing value uses mode and One-Dimensional Naive Bayes Classifier (1DNBC) to determine the performance analysis by using Support Vector Machine (SVM) for the prediction of car insurance participation. A better method is seen from the accuracy. Based on the simulation is obtained the same results for imputation using mode and One-Dimensional Naive Bayes are 1.00, which when examined further turns out to be the imputation of each missing value with the mode and prediction of imputation with One-Dimensional Naive Bayes are the same.

TI  - Large Scale Financial Filing Analysis on HPCC Systems
T2  - 2020 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON BIG DATA (BIG DATA)
CP  - 8th IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data)
AB  - Insights from public companies' financial filings are necessary for securities analysts and investors to make the right investment decisions. Synthesizing salient facts from such filings is a complex language task, especially now as the data volume is growing at an overwhelming pace. To ease human labor in this process, our work proposed a financial filing analysis pipeline which automatically scrapes financial filings, generates the embeddings of the contextual data and performs sentiment analysis in order to predict future performance of the underlying companies. The pipeline is built on top of Big Data processing platform HPCC Systems to enable the capability of processing large amounts of financial filings in a scalable and timely manner. By applying word embedding and machine learning models to a large amount of SEC financial filings, our pipeline is able to process 20 GB of XBRL files - 5,000 filing documents for more than 3,500 companies - into 50,000 sentence embeddings within 5 minutes and transform the same data to TF-IDF embedding in about 8 minutes. To test sentiment analysis, we randomly sampled and manually labeled 5,000 SEC filings. As a result, the sentiment analysis suggested that the usefulness of stock price as a metric is specific to each industry and overall market, but is usable as long as the scope of inquiry is sufficiently narrow. Additionally, while our model is trained only on 5,000 manually labeled filings with unigrams and a final loss of 0.09, the results of the sentiment analysis exhibited discriminatory power exceeding naive label selection through random or biased choice, suggesting that there is efficacy in using Natural Language Processing to analyze SEC filings.

TI  - Automatic Classification of Thyroid Findings Using Static and Contextualized Ensemble Natural Language Processing Systems: Development Study
T2  - JMIR MEDICAL INFORMATICS
AB  - Background: In the case of Korean institutions and enterprises that collect nonstandardized and nonunified formats of electronic medical examination results from multiple medical institutions, a group of experienced nurses who can understand the results and related contexts initially classified the reports manually. The classification guidelines were established by years of workers' clinical experiences and there were attempts to automate the classification work. However, there have been problems in which rule-based algorithms or human labor-intensive efforts can be time-consuming or limited owing to high potential errors. We investigated natural language processing (NLP) architectures and proposed ensemble models to create automated classifiers.
   Objective: This study aimed to develop practical deep learning models with electronic medical records from 284 health care institutions and open-source corpus data sets for automatically classifying 3 thyroid conditions: healthy, caution required, and critical. The primary goal is to increase the overall accuracy of the classification, yet there are practical and industrial needs to correctly predict healthy (negative) thyroid condition data, which are mostly medical examination results, and minimize false-negative rates under the prediction of healthy thyroid conditions.
   Methods: The data sets included thyroid and comprehensive medical examination reports. The textual data are not only documented in fully complete sentences but also written in lists of words or phrases. Therefore, we propose static and contextualized ensemble NLP network (SCENT) systems to successfully reflect static and contextual information and handle incomplete sentences. We prepared each convolution neural network (CNN)-, long short-term memory (LSTM)-, and efficiently learning an encoder that classifies token replacements accurately (ELECTRA)-based ensemble model by training or fine-tuning them multiple times. Through comprehensive experiments, we propose 2 versions of ensemble models, SCENT-v1 and SCENT-v2, with the single-architecture-based CNN, LSTM, and ELECTRA ensemble models for the best classification performance and practical use, respectively. SCENT-v1 is an ensemble of CNN and ELECTRA ensemble models, and SCENT-v2 is a hierarchical ensemble of CNN, LSTM, and ELECTRA ensemble models. SCENT-v2 first classifies the 3 labels using an ELECTRA ensemble model and then reclassifies them using an ensemble model of CNN and LSTM if the ELECTRA ensemble model predicted them as "healthy" labels.
   Results: SCENT-v1 outperformed all the suggested models, with the highest F1 score (92.56%). SCENT-v2 had the second-highest recall value (94.44%) and the fewest misclassifications for caution-required thyroid condition while maintaining 0 classification error for the critical thyroid condition under the prediction of the healthy thyroid condition.
   Conclusions: The proposed SCENT demonstrates good classification performance despite the unique characteristics of the Korean language and problems of data lack and imbalance, especially for the extremely low amount of critical condition data.
   The result of SCENT-v1 indicates that different perspectives of static and contextual input token representations can enhance classification performance. SCENT-v2 has a strong impact on the prediction of healthy thyroid conditions.

Recent research has been focused on developing supervised methods to automatically assign International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes from clinical notes. However, supervised approaches rely on ICD code data stored in the hospital EMR system and is subject to bias rising from the practice and coding behavior. Consequently, portability of trained supervised algorithms to external EMR systems may suffer.
   Method: We developed an unsupervised knowledge integration (UNITE) algorithm to automatically assign ICD codes for a specific disease by analyzing clinical narrative notes via semantic relevance assessment. The algorithm was validated using coded ICD data for 6 diseases from Partners HealthCare (PHS) Biobank and Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-III). We compared the performance of UNITE against penalized logistic regression (LR), topic modeling, and neural network models within each EMR system. We additionally evaluated the portability of UNITE by training at PHS Biobank and validating at MIMIC-III, and vice versa.
   Results: UNITE achieved an averaged AUC of 0.91 at PHS and 0.92 at MIMIC over 6 diseases, comparable to LR and MLP. It had substantially better performance than topic models. In regards to portability, the performance of UNITE was consistent across different EMR systems, superior to LR, topic models and neural network models.
   Conclusion: UNITE accurately assigns ICD code in EMR without requiring human labor, and has major advantages over commonly used machine learning approaches. In addition, the UNITE attained stable performance and high portability across EMRs in different institutions.

TI  - Connected Components-based Colour Image Representations of Vibrations for a Two-stage Fault Diagnosis of Roller Bearings Using Convolutional Neural Networks
T2  - CHINESE JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERING
AB  - Roller bearing failure is one of the most common faults in rotating machines. Various techniques for bearing fault diagnosis based on faults feature extraction have been proposed. But feature extraction from fault signals requires expert prior information and human labour. Recently, deep learning algorithms have been applied extensively in the condition monitoring of rotating machines to learn features automatically from the input data. Given its robust performance in image recognition, the convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture has been widely used to learn automatically discriminative features from vibration images and classify health conditions. This paper proposes and evaluates a two-stage method RGBVI-CNN for roller bearings fault diagnosis. The first stage in the proposed method is to generate the RGB vibration images (RGBVIs) from the input vibration signals. To begin this process, first, the 1-D vibration signals were converted to 2-D grayscale vibration Images. Once the conversion was completed, the regions of interest (ROI) were found in the converted 2-D grayscale vibration images. Finally, to produce vibration images with more discriminative characteristics, an algorithm was applied to the 2-D grayscale vibration images to produce connected components-based RGB vibration images (RGBVIs) with sets of colours and texture features. In the second stage, with these RGBVIs a CNN-based architecture was employed to learn automatically features from the RGBVIs and to classify bearing health conditions. Two cases of fault classification of rolling element bearings are used to validate the proposed method. Experimental results of this investigation demonstrate that RGBVI-CNN can generate advantageous health condition features from bearing vibration signals and classify the health conditions under different working loads with high accuracy. Moreover, several classification models trained using RGBVI-CNN offered high performance in the testing results of the overall classification accuracy, precision, recall, and F-score.

TI  - Learning to Monitor Machine Health with Convolutional Bi-Directional LSTM Networks
T2  - SENSORS
AB  - In modern manufacturing systems and industries, more and more research efforts have been made in developing effective machine health monitoring systems. Among various machine health monitoring approaches, data-driven methods are gaining in popularity due to the development of advanced sensing and data analytic techniques. However, considering the noise, varying length and irregular sampling behind sensory data, this kind of sequential data cannot be fed into classification and regression models directly. Therefore, previous work focuses on feature extraction/fusion methods requiring expensive human labor and high quality expert knowledge. With the development of deep learning methods in the last few years, which redefine representation learning from raw data, a deep neural network structure named Convolutional Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory networks (CBLSTM) has been designed here to address raw sensory data. CBLSTM firstly uses CNN to extract local features that are robust and informative from the sequential input. Then, bi-directional LSTM is introduced to encode temporal information. Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs) are able to capture long-term dependencies and model sequential data, and the bi-directional structure enables the capture of past and future contexts. Stacked, fully-connected layers and the linear regression layer are built on top of bi-directional LSTMs to predict the target value. Here, a real-life tool wear test is introduced, and our proposed CBLSTM is able to predict the actual tool wear based on raw sensory data. The experimental results have shown that our model is able to outperform several state-of-the-art baseline methods.

TI  - Combining translation-invariant wavelet frames and convolutional neural network for intelligent tool wear state identification
T2  - COMPUTERS IN INDUSTRY
AB  - On-machine monitoring of tool wear in machining processes has found its importance to reduce equipment downtime and reduce tooling costs. As the tool wears out gradually, the contact state of the cutting edge and the workpiece changes, which has a significant influence on the vibration state of the spindle. The performance of traditional intelligent fault diagnosis methods depend on feature extraction of dynamic signals, which requires expert knowledge and human labor. Recently, deep learning algorithms have been applied widely in machine health monitoring. In this paper, we present a novel intelligent technique for tool wear state recognition using machine spindle vibration signals. The proposed technique combines derived wavelet frames (DWFs) and convolutional neural network (CNN). Constructed based on dual tree wavelets, DWF are equipped with merits of centralized multiresolution and nearly translation-invariance. In this method, DWFs are employed to decompose the original signal into frequency bands of different bandwidths and different center frequencies, which are more pronounced as the tool wears. Further, the reconstructed sub-signals are stacked into a 2-D signal matrix to match the structure of 2-D CNN while retaining more dynamic information. The 2-D convolutional neural network is utilized to automatically recognize features from the multiscale 2-D signal matrix. End-milling experiments were performed on a S45C steel workpiece at different machining parameters. The experiment results of the recognition for tool wear state show the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Learning Fine-Grained Fact-Article Correspondence in Legal Cases
T2  - IEEE-ACM TRANSACTIONS ON AUDIO SPEECH AND LANGUAGE PROCESSING
AB  - Automatically recommending relevant law articles to a given legal case has attracted much attention as it can greatly release human labor from searching over the large database of laws. However, current researches only support coarse-grained recommendation where all relevant articles are predicted as a whole without explaining which specific fact each article is relevant with. Since one case can be formed of many supporting facts, traversing over them to verify the correctness of recommendation results can be time-consuming. We believe that learning fine-grained correspondence between each single fact and law articles is crucial for an accurate and trustworthy AI system. With this motivation, we perform a pioneering study and create a corpus with manually annotated fact-article correspondences. We treat the learning as a text matching task and propose a multi-level matching network to address it. To help the model better digest the content of law articles, we parse articles in form of premise-conclusion pairs with random forest. Experiments show that the parsed form yielded better performance and the resulting model surpassed other popular text matching baselines. Furthermore, we compare with previous researches and find that establishing the fine-grained fact-article correspondences can improve the recommendation accuracy by a large margin. Our best system reaches an F1 score of 96.3%, making it of great potential for practical use. It can also significantly boost the downstream task of legal decision prediction, increasing the F1 score by up to 12.7%. Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/gjdnju/MLMN.

TI  - Bellwether Analysis: Searching for Cost-Effective Query-Defined Predictors in Large Databases
T2  - ACM TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY FROM DATA
AB  - How to mine massive datasets is a challenging problem with great potential value. Motivated by this challenge, much effort has concentrated on developing scalable versions of machine learning algorithms. However, the cost of mining large datasets is not just computational; preparing the datasets into the "right form" so that learning algorithms can be applied is usually costly, due to the human labor that is typically required and a large number of choices in data preparation, which include selecting different subsets of data and aggregating data at different granularities. We make the key observation that, for a number of practically motivated problems, these choices can be defined using database queries and analyzed in an automatic and systematic manner. Specifically, we propose a new class of data-mining problem, called bellwether analysis, in which the goal is to find a few query-defined predictors (e. g., first week sales of Peoria, IL of an item) that can be used to accurately predict the result of a target query (e. g., first year worldwide sales of the item) from a large number of queries that define candidate predictors. To make a prediction for a new item, the data needed to generate such predictors has to be collected (e. g., selling the new item in Peoria, IL for a week and collecting the sales data). A useful predictor is one that has high prediction accuracy and a low data-collection cost. We call such a cost-effective predictor a bellwether.
   This article introduces bellwether analysis, which integrates database query processing and predictive modeling into a single framework, and provides scalable algorithms for large datasets that cannot fit in main memory. Through a series of extensive experiments, we show that bellwethers do exist in real-world databases, and that our computation techniques achieve good efficiency on large datasets.

TI  - AUTOMATED CHARACTERIZATION OF CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES USING WAVELET TRANSFORM FEATURES EXTRACTED FROM ECG SIGNALS
T2  - JOURNAL OF MECHANICS IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY
AB  - Cardiovascular disease has been the leading cause of death worldwide. Electrocardiogram (ECG)-based heart disease diagnosis is simple, fast, cost effective and non-invasive. However, interpreting ECG waveforms can be taxing for a clinician who has to deal with hundreds of patients during a day. We propose computing machinery to reduce the workload of clinicians and to streamline the clinical work processes. Replacing human labor with machine work can lead to cost savings. Furthermore, it is possible to improve the diagnosis quality by reducing inter- and intra-observer variability. To support that claim, we created a computer program that recognizes normal, Dilated Cardiomyopathy (DCM), Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM) or Myocardial Infarction (MI) ECG signals. The computer program combined Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) based feature extraction and K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN) classification for discriminating the signal classes. The system was verified with tenfold cross validation based on labeled data from the PTB diagnostic ECG database. During the validation, we adjusted the number of neighbors k for the machine learning algorithm. For k = 3, training set has an accuracy and cross validation of 98.33% and 95%, respectively. However, when k = 5, it showed constant for training set but dropped drastically to 80% for cross-validation. Hence, training set k = 5 prevails. Furthermore, a confusion matrix proved that normal data was identified with 96.7% accuracy, 99.6% sensitivity and 99.4% specificity. This means an error of 3.3% will occur. For every 30 normal signals, the classifier will mislabel only 1 of the them as HCM. With these results, we are confident that the proposed system can improve the speed and accuracy with which normal and diseased subjects are identified. Diseased subjects can be treated earlier which improves their probability of survival.

TI  - Lung lesions detection from CT images based on the modified Faster R-CNN
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2020 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPUTER, INFORMATION AND TELECOMMUNICATION SYSTEMS (CITS)
CP  - International Conference on Computer, Information and Telecommunication Systems (IEEE CITS)
AB  - At the end of 2019, the outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic brought huge economic losses all around the world, and also seriously affect human work, life and study. A large number of infected patients brought huge workload to doctors, but deep learning methods can effectively assist their diagnosis. This paper is based on Faster R-CNN, an end-to-end target detection model, to realize the detection of lesions in CT images of the novel coronavirus, which contributes to track the later condition of the confirmed patients and conduct timely treatment. Firstly, Kmeans++ was carried out to cluster the dimensions of the bounding box of the ground truth in annotated CT images, and appropriate anchors sizes and ratios were selected. Then, the performance of the Faster R-CNN model based on VGG-16 and ResNet-50 on the original datasets and the augment datasets is compared. Finally, the results show that, in the enhanced dataset, the Faster R-CNN model based on VGG-16 achieved a better performance, the Recall and Precision of which on the overall test set reached 68.12% and 65.58% respectively, and the missed detection rate(MR) was 31.88%.

TI  - Sampling and nutrient recommendations - The future
T2  - COMMUNICATIONS IN SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT ANALYSIS
CP  - 1997 International Soil and Plant Analysis Symposium
AB  - Fertile soils are one of the most important resources on earth. Sustainable agriculture should use this resource in such a way that the present and future human needs for food or other agricultural goods are warranted whereas the quality of the environment and the natural resources remain preserved. Plant production needs resources of different origins and most of them are maintained according to certain soil parameters. But as soils are neither static, nor homogenous in space and time, the standard approach of uniform. application rates always results in a side by side of over and under supply. Precision Agriculture aims at addressing this spatial variability but for this task physico-chemical images [Digital Agro Resource Maps (DARM)] of the land are required. Efforts in acquiring these maps are actually one of the major bottlenecks for the exploitation of Precision Agriculture at the farm level. Most recent developments in strategies for reducing sampling efforts without loosing information are in "self surveying". This is a method by which basic spatial information of soil texture, organic matter content and geomorphology for instance are gathered just by human skills and "directed", or, "smart" sampling which uses already existing spatial information of a site to guide sampling to representative plots, Optical sensors for major important soil information like soil texture and plant available nutrients are far away from being realized. Already existing approaches for on-the-go measurements of soil features are still soil invasive and therefore slow and ineffective as far as human labor is concerned. However, these methods might benefit a lot from developments in robot techniques. Remote sensing is a promising method for gathering spatial information of soils, but will always need a certain amount of work on the ground to allow interpretation and calibration of images. In so far it fits well with the strategy of "directed" sampling, Temporal availability and visibility are major problems for remote sensing which might be solved by new technological approaches Like unmanned air vehicles (UAV) or stationary "surf-eyes". New approaches are also required for the interpretation of spatially distributed son and plant analysis data and how fertilizer recommendations are derived to be from this information. It is obvious from the first experiences with Precision Agriculture under practical farming conditions that the standard approach of fertilizer recommendation does not provide the best basis in the sense of sustainable farming for a successful implementation of Precision Agriculture.

TI  - Monitored and controlled underwater scissor arm manipulator using Pixy camera
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF GEO-MARINE SCIENCES
AB  - Underwater vehicle manipulator system (UVMS) generally consists of a camera unit and robotic manipulator. Its main function is to replace human work in underwater manipulation tasks. Most commercially available manipulators are not designed for autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) because the vehicle does not have sufficient power supply to drive these manipulators which are electro-hydraulically driven. A proposed solution is to invest in development of low power underwater manipulator to deepen studies in AUV. Thus, this research has an objective of developing an underwater manipulator for small scale AUV. In this research, the manipulator is used in an object recovery task. An acrylic scissor arm which is electro-mechanically driven is used as manipulator in this research. Permanent magnets are used as its end effector. A Pixy CMUcam5 vision sensor is paired with this manipulator to navigate the AUV and control the manipulator. The usage of planar pressure housing helps in reducing light refraction effect of underwater environment that may affect the sensor's accuracy. From the simulation done using Solid Works, it is found out that type 316L stainless steel is the best choice for the manipulator developed. To evaluate the performance of the UVMS developed, a series of tests are carried out. Based on the results obtained, it is known that the system has high speed and consistency with minimum time delay between input and output. As long as an object has distinct colour signature from its background and its surrounding is clear and well illuminated, the Pixy vision sensor can detect that object regardless of the distance between the sensor and the object.

TI  - Integration of manual and automatic text categorization. A categorization workbench for text-based email and spam
T2  - KI 2004: ADVANCES IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, PROCEEDINGS
CP  - 27th Annual German Conference on Artificial Intelligence
AB  - As a method structuring information and knowledge contained in texts, text categorization can be to a great extend automated. The automatic text classification systems implement machine learning algorithms and need training samples. In commercial applications however, the automatic categorization appear to come up against limiting factors. For example, it turns out to be difficult to reduce the sample complexity without the categorization quality in terms of recall and precision will suffer. Instead of trying to fully replace the human work by machine, it could be more effective and ultimately efficient to let human and machine cooperate. So we have developed a categorization workbench to realise synergy between manual and machine categorization. To compare the categorization workbench with common automatic classification systems, the automatic categorizer of the IBM DB2 Information Integrator for Content has been chosen for tests. The test results show that, benefiting from the incorporation of user's domain knowledge, the categorization workbench can improve the recall by a factor of two till four with the same number of training samples as the automatic categorizer uses. Further, to get a comparable categorization quality, the categorization workbench just needs an eighth till a quarter of the training samples as the automatic categorizer does.

TI  - Boosting drug named entity recognition using an aggregate classifier
T2  - ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN MEDICINE
AB  - Objective: Drug named entity recognition (NER) is a critical step for complex biomedical NLP tasks such as the extraction of pharmacogenomic, pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic parameters. Large quantities of high quality training data are almost always a prerequisite for employing supervised machine-learning techniques to achieve high classification performance. However, the human labour needed to produce and maintain such resources is a significant limitation. In this study, we improve the performance of drug NER without relying exclusively on manual annotations.
   Methods: We perform drug NER using either a small gold-standard corpus (120 abstracts) or no corpus at all. In our approach, we develop a voting system to combine a number of heterogeneous models, based on dictionary knowledge, gold-standard corpora and silver annotations, to enhance performance. To improve recall, we employed genetic programming to evolve 11 regular-expression patterns that capture common drug suffixes and used them as an extra means for recognition. Materials: Our approach uses a dictionary of drug names, i.e. DrugBank, a small manually annotated corpus, i.e. the pharmacokinetic corpus, and a part of the UKPMC database, as raw biomedical text. Gold-standard and silver annotated data are used to train maximum entropy and multinomial logistic regression classifiers.
   Results: Aggregating drug NER methods, based on gold-standard annotations, dictionary knowledge and patterns, improved the performance on models trained on gold-standard annotations, only, achieving a maximum F-score of 95%. In addition, combining models trained on silver annotations, dictionary knowledge and patterns are shown to achieve comparable performance to models trained exclusively on gold-standard data. The main reason appears to be the morphological similarities shared among drug names.
   Conclusion: We conclude that gold-standard data are not a hard requirement for drug NER. Combining heterogeneous models build on dictionary knowledge can achieve similar or comparable classification performance with that of the best performing model trained on gold-standard annotations.

TI  - Learning from similarity and information extraction from structured documents
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL ON DOCUMENT ANALYSIS AND RECOGNITION
AB  - The automation of document processing has recently gained attention owing to its great potential to reduce manual work. Any improvement in information extraction systems or reduction in their error rates aids companies working with business documents because lowering reliance on cost-heavy and error-prone human work significantly improves the revenue. Neural networks have been applied to this area before, but they have been trained only on relatively small datasets with hundreds of documents so far. To successfully explore deep learning techniques and improve information extraction, we compiled a dataset with more than 25,000 documents. We expand on our previous work in which we proved that convolutions, graph convolutions, and self-attention can work together and exploit all the information within a structured document. Taking the fully trainable method one step further, we now design and examine various approaches to using Siamese networks, concepts of similarity, one-shot learning, and context/memory awareness. The aim is to improve micro F-1 of per-word classification in the huge real-world document dataset. The results verify that trainable access to a similar (yet still different) page, together with its already known target information, improves the information extraction. The experiments confirm that all proposed architecture parts (Siamese networks, employing class information, query-answer attention module and skip connections to a similar page) are all required to beat the previous results. The best model yields an 8.25% gain in the F-1 score over the previous state-of-the-art results. Qualitative analysis verifies that the new model performs better for all target classes. Additionally, multiple structural observations about the causes of the underperformance of some architectures are revealed, since all the techniques used in this work are not problem-specific and can be generalized for other tasks and contexts.

TI  - DeepWindow: Sliding Window Based on Deep Learning for Road Extraction From Remote Sensing Images
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
AB  - The road centerline extraction is the key step of the road network extraction and modeling. The hand-craft feature engineering in the traditional road extraction methods is unstable, which makes the extracted road centerline deviated from the road center in complex cases and even results in overall extracting errors. Recently, the road centerline extraction methods based on semantic segmentation employing deep neural network greatly outperformed the traditional methods. Nevertheless, the pixel-wise labels for training deep learning models are expensive and the postprocess of road segmentation is error-prone. Inspired by the work of human pose estimation, we propose DeepWindow, a novel method to automatically extract the road network from remote sensing images. DeepWindow uses a sliding window guided by a CNN-based decision function to track the road network directly from the images without the prior of road segmentation. First of all, we design and train a CNN model to estimate the road center points inside a patch. Then, the road seeds are automatically searched patch by patch employing the CNN model. Finally, starting from seeds, our method first estimates the road direction using a Fourier spectrum analysis algorithm and then iteratively tracks the road center-line along the road direction guided by the CNN model. In our method, the CNN model is trained by point annotations, which greatly reduces the training costs comparing to those in semantic model training. Our method achieves comparable performance with the state-of-the-art road extraction methods, and extensive experiments indicate that our method is robust to the point deviation.

The best model yields an 8.25% gain in the F1\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$F_{1}$$\end{document} score over the previous state-of-the-art results. Qualitative analysis verifies that the new model performs better for all target classes. Additionally, multiple structural observations about the causes of the underperformance of some architectures are revealed, since all the techniques used in this work are not problem-specific and can be generalized for other tasks and contexts.

TI  - Fetal Cardiovascular Decompensation During Labor Predicted From the Individual Heart Rate Tracing: A Machine Learning Approach in Near-Term Fetal Sheep Model
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PEDIATRICS
AB  - Background: When exposed to repetitive umbilical cord occlusions (UCO) with worsening acidemia, fetuses eventually develop cardiovascular decompensation manifesting as pathological hypotensive arterial blood pressure (ABP) responses to fetal heart rate (FHR) decelerations. Failure to maintain cardiac output during labor is a key event leading up to brain injury. We reported that the timing of the event when a fetus begins to exhibit this cardiovascular phenotype is highly individual and was impossible to predict.
   Objective: We hypothesized that this phenotype would be reflected in the individual behavior of heart rate variability (HRV) as measured by root mean square of successive differences of R-R intervals (RMSSD), a measure of vagal modulation of HRV, which is known to increase with worsening acidemia. This is clinically relevant because HRV can be computed in real-time intrapartum. Consequently, we aimed to predict the individual timing of the event when a hypotensive ABP pattern would emerge in a fetus from a series of continuous RMSSD data.
   Study Design: Fourteen near-term fetal sheep were chronically instrumented with vascular catheters to record fetal arterial blood pressure, umbilical cord occluder to mimic uterine contractions occurring during human labor and ECG electrodes to compute the ECG-derived HRV measure RMSSD. All animals were studied over a similar to 6 h period. After a 1-2 h baseline control period, the animals underwent mild, moderate, and severe series of repetitive UCO. We applied the recently developed machine learning algorithm to detect physiologically meaningful changes in RMSSD dynamics with worsening acidemia and hypotensive responses to FHR decelerations. To mimic clinical scenarios using an ultrasound-based 4 Hz FHR sampling rate, we recomputed RMSSD from FHR sampled at 4 Hz and compared the performance of our algorithm under both conditions (1,000 Hz vs. 4 Hz).
   Results: The RMSSD values were highly non-stationary, with four different regimes and three regime changes, corresponding to a baseline period followed by mild, moderate, and severe UCO series. Each time series was characterized by seemingly randomly occurring (in terms of timing of the individual onset) increase in RMSSD values at different time points during the moderate UCO series and at the start of the severe UCO series. This event manifested as an increasing trend in RMSSD values, which counter-intuitively emerged as a period of relative stationarity for the time series. Our algorithm identified these change points as the individual time points of cardiovascular decompensation with 92% sensitivity, 86% accuracy and 92% precision which corresponded to 14 +/- 21 min before the visual identification. In the 4 Hz RMSSD time series, the algorithm detected the event with 3 times earlier detection times than at 1,000 Hz, i.e., producing false positive alarms with 50% sensitivity, 21% accuracy, and 27% precision. We identified the overestimation of baseline FHR variability by RMSSD at a 4 Hz sampling rate to be the cause of this phenomenon.
   Conclusions: The key finding is demonstration of FHR monitoring to detect fetal cardiovascular decompensation during labor. This validates the hypothesis that our HRV-based algorithm identifies individual time points of ABP responses to UCO with worsening acidemia by extracting change point information from the physiologically related fluctuations in the RMSSD signal. This performance depends on the acquisition accuracy of beat to beat fluctuations achieved in trans-abdominal ECG devices and fails at the sampling rate used clinically in ultrasound-based systems. This has implications for implementing such an approach in clinical practice.
