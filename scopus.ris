AB  - Computer-based technologies have had a significant influence on the techniques employed in a wide range of real-world domains. Many fields, such as medicine and agriculture, rely heavily on computers for data gathering and analysis in order to provide useful information. Precision agriculture, a modern agricultural paradigm, analyzes the entire farm as a collection of tiny units and identifies anomalies in output and demand for those units. The ultimate objective of precision agriculture is to minimize the cost of farming in order to maximize profit. Innovative agricultural methods are being used by smart farmers. ICT, automation, and WSN technologies can be utilized to reduce the negative impacts of experience-based irrigation techniques. ICT has the ability to boost crop growth and production in the agricultural sector. The application of wireless sensor technology in micro irrigation projects can increase production per unit of water, reduce water and energy consumption, and reduce the usage of human labor in agriculture fields. WSN technology may be utilized in a number of applications, however there are several problems and restrictions in large-scale sensor network implementation. Massive size, restricted access, and dynamic monitoring are examples of systemic problems. The combination of actuation methods with wireless sensor networking may be employed in a variety of applications. In vast spatiotemporal settings, mobile ad-hoc networks may be utilized to produce and evaluate many parameters. Object detection and grading is emerging area in precision agriculture. It is vital in production estimation. © Kalahari Journals.

AB  - In recent years complex food security issues caused by climatic changes, limitations in human labour, and increasing production costs require a strategic approach in addressing problems. The emergence of artificial intelligence due to the capability of recent advances in computing architectures could become a new alternative to existing solutions. Deep learning algorithms in computer vision for image classification and object detection can facilitate the agriculture industry, especially in paddy cultivation, to alleviate human efforts in laborious, burdensome, and repetitive tasks. Optimal planting density is a crucial factor for paddy cultivation as it will influence the quality and quantity of production. There have been several studies involving planting density using computer vision and remote sensing approaches. While most of the studies have shown promising results, they have disadvantages and show room for improvement. One of the disadvantages is that the studies aim to detect and count all the paddy seedlings to determine planting density. The defective paddy seedlings’ locations are not pointed out to help farmers during the sowing process. In this work we aimed to explore several deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) models to determine which one performs the best for defective paddy seedling detection using aerial imagery. Thus, we evaluated the accuracy, robustness, and inference latency of one-and two-stage pretrained object detectors combined with state-of-the-art feature extractors such as EfficientNet, ResNet50, and MobilenetV2 as a backbone. We also investigated the effect of transfer learning with fine-tuning on the performance of the aforementioned pretrained models. Experimental results showed that our proposed methods were capable of detecting the defective paddy rice seedlings with the highest precision and an F1-Score of 0.83 and 0.77, respectively, using a one-stage pretrained object detector called EfficientDet-D1 EficientNet. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - For robotic machining, accurate and automatic inspection of finished surface is necessary for implementation in the site lapping process. Modern inspection systems based on smart sensor technology such as image processing and machine vision have been widely spread into many industries. These systems along with the smart factory concept not only enhance the inspection accuracy but also decrease human works substantially. In this paper, we propose a method for automatic levelling of machined surface with respect to roughness values, adopting specular light-based vision technique. The study mainly concerns the development of surface roughness levelling system associated with textural analysis related to surface topography. It is supported by the fundamental property of light reflection: reflection changes from diffuse to specular depending upon surface texture. A rough surface having tool marks produces contrast in grayscale values, resulting in the decrease of intensity value and vice versa. Image processing technique was adopted to find the underlying grayscale values of inspected surface. The result showed a nonlinear increase in grayscale values as roughness decreases. The highest image resolution can be achieved when surface normal corresponds to perspective center of camera, so the concept was extended for inclined and curved surfaces. To obtain high accuracy in precise measurements, a multiscale measuring method was developed for a wide range of roughness, which does not require an isolated system, but only change in camera distance for high-resolution measurement. The proposed technique showed surface roughness levelling with high accuracy and resolution up to 20 nm (Ra). The results indicate that this technique can be used for multiscale surface levelling of the free-form metal surfaces. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Waste management and monitoring is a major concern in the context of the environment, and has a significant impact on human health. The concept of the Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) can help people in everyday tasks in life. This study proposes a smart trash bin to help solve the problem of waste management and monitoring. Traditional methods of garbage disposal require human labor, and pose a hazard to the worker. The proposed smart garbage bin can move itself by using ultrasonic sensors and a web camera, which serves as its “eyes.” Because the smart garbage bin is designed for indoor use and mobility, we use a Bluetooth beacon for location tracking, whereby the bin transmits a constant signal that the other devices in the environment can detect. A smart garbage bin was developed in this study to be used in the E315 research room in the Electrical Engineering Department of the National Chin-Yi University of Technology. An Android application was also developed to help users monitor waste in the smart bin. © 2022, Tech Science Press. All rights reserved.

AB  - Robotics and automation are essential to improve life quality by assisting and substituting humans in dangerous tasks. Starting from this idea, this paper introduces an innovative gripper that can be employed in the new industrial policy, such as Industry 4.0, in which machines and humans work together. In particular, the paper describes the study of a new soft gripper as a modification of a underactuated gripper previously designed. The new proposed gripper presents an improved design, and it employs more sustainable materials resulting more compliant and adaptable. Therefore, it can be introduced within different industrial and service contexts with the aim of improving the process efficiency and even sustainability, according to SDG9. In particular, the proposed gripper can be used in the recycling and waste disposal chain with a consequent improvement of workers’ health, helping the achievement of SDG3, SDG8 and SDG12. The main feature of the gripper is the modularity, which makes it highly versatile and reconfigurable. reducing waste and obsolescence. In addition, the paper investigates the application of a new environment-friendly material for realising the phalanges comparing it with different materials in terms of structural mechanics by means of FEM analysis. Results demonstrate that both the new design and the employment of the new “green” material make the gripper more efficient and helpful in achieving different Sustainable Development Goals. This is also the basis of a circular perspective for the protection of the environment and the optimization of costs and resources and human lives. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Construction is an industry that could benefit significantly from automation, yet still relies heavily on manual human labor. Thus, we investigate how a robotic arm can be used to assemble a structure from predefined discrete building blocks autonomously. Since assembling structures is a challenging task that involves complex contact dynamics, we propose to use a combination of reinforcement learning and planning for this task. In this work, we take a first step towards autonomous construction by training a controller to place a single building block in simulation. Our evaluations show that trial-and-error algorithms that have minimal prior knowledge about the problem to be solved, so called model-free deep reinforcement learning algorithms, can be successfully employed. We conclude that the achieved results, albeit imperfect, serve as a proof of concept and indicate the directions for further research to enable more complex assemblies involving multiple building elements. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Regular Ship hull maintenance is an essential for sustainability. The maintenance work of ship hulls that involve human labor suffers from many shortcomings. Maintenance robots have been introduced for drydocks to eliminate these shortcomings. An energy-efficient Complete Coverage Path Planning (CCPP) is a crucial requirement from a ship hull maintenance robot. This paper proposes a novel energy-efficient CCPP method based on Glasius Bioinspired Neural Network (GBNN) for a ship hull inspection robot. The proposed method accounts for a comprehensive energy model for path planning. This energy model reflects the energy usage of a ship hull maintenance robot due to changes in direction, distance, and vertical position. Furthermore, the proposed method is effective for dynamic workspaces since it performs online path planning. These are the major contributions made to state of the art by the work proposed in this paper. The behavior and the performance of the proposed method have been compared against state of the art through simulations considering Hornbill, a multipurpose ship hull maintenance robot. The validation confirms the ability of the proposed in realizing a complete coverage of a given dynamic workspace. According to the statistical outcomes of the comparison, the performance of the proposed method significantly surpasses that of the state-of-the-art methods in terms of energy usage. Therefore, the proposed method contributes to the development of energy-efficient CCPP methods for a ship hull maintenance robot. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Date is a fruit rich in dietary fiber with global commercial value due to its nutritional and medicinal value in curing and preventing various diseases. The grading and sorting process of date fruits is still a complex task in the industry requiring a great deal of human expertise. The breakthrough of deep learning in computer vision has opened up new path for various industrial applications. Therefore, the objective of this paper is to employ convolutional deep learning network and develop an improved automatic sorting system for classifying the images of three main varieties of date fruits, namely, Ekhlas, Nbute Sultan, and Shayshi. To this end, a convolutional neural network (CNN) was designed and trained from scratch to efficiently learn and discern the different varieties of date fruits with high accuracy. The generalization ability of the developed CNN architecture was improved with a combination of convolutional and max-pooling layers. Added to, it was trained from scratch with nearly 3165 date fruit images which include 1055 images of each three varieties. A comparative analysis with different gradient descent optimization methods on the developed CNN architecture is presented. The obtained results testified the efficacy and generalization ability of the developed CNN architecture to discriminate date cultivars with higher accuracy. Therein, the integration of the developed CNN architecture in a suitable affordable framework, will make it possible to reduce the inconsistency and lag of human labor by raising the accuracy and speed of the process. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

AB  - This study shows the possibilities of how to replace tedious human labor—scouting of yellow sticky traps (YST) for whiteflies—using artificial cognitive vision, specifically the deep convolutional network (CNN), as a part of the more complex system—BERABOT. The used CNN is the Faster R-CNN trained by deep transfer learning to substitute human scouting when the low whiteflies infection phase was specifically targeted. The training was conducted on pictures taken inside the heated and lighted tomato production greenhouse of “Bezdínek Farm” in Dolni Lutyne, Czechia. Used pictures were collected in a way planned for future fully automated robotic applications in the BERABOT system. The achieved results were compared with the scouting results of a professional phytopathologist. The trained employee’s scouting results against the professional phytopathologist accomplished root-mean-square error (RMSE) equal to 4.23, while the developed CNN model was evaluated to be 5.83. The results presented here open up new frontiers for further CNN model tuning leading to the potential in substituting an employee(s) in the future and make tomato production less expensive and less human labor dependent. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

AB  - The wireless data collection for instance the Received Signal Strength (RSS) of the Wireless Fidelity (Wi-Fi) remained unfavourable in the Indoor Positioning System utilizing the signal fingerprinting approach. This is because the enormous sampling time and routines works making it tedious human labour. To alleviate this issue, we propose to use a robot for wireless data collection. The robot, named 'ICSiBOT' is a service robot with multiple purpose such as assisting human in daily lives, guest or hospitality robot and man others. This paper mainly describes the ICSiBOT robot face with speech recognition technology and the integration of the robot face to the motion controller. The experimental was conducted to see the correlation between the synthesized instructions from the speech in terms of distance need to be travelled i.e., the location for wireless signal collection and translate them into actual distance travelled. The results showed that the robot is able to travel to the specific distance as instructed to the robot face. © 2021 Institute of Physics Publishing. All rights reserved.

AB  - Earth's surface water plays an important role in the global water cycle, environmental processes, and human society, and it is necessary to dynamically capture the distribution and extent of surface water on Earth. However, due to the high complexity of the surface environment of Earth, the current surface water mapping methods are limited in applicability and precision. In this study, to explore an automatic and applicable model for surface water mapping, particularly for the regions with highly heterogenous backgrounds, we adopted state-of-the-art deep learning techniques and structured a new model, namely, WatNet, for surface water mapping. Specifically, we combined a state-of-the-art image classification model and a semantic segmentation model into an improved deep learning model. For the fine-scale identification of small water bodies, the combined model was further improved with surface water mapping-tailored design. To learn the surface water features of worldwide regions, a surface water knowledge base that consists of worldwide satellite images was built in this study. The newly structured WatNet model was tested on three highly heterogeneous regions, and as demonstrated by the results, 1) the trained WatNet model achieved the highest accuracies, which were above 95%, for all the selected test regions; 2) the new structured WatNet model yields significant improvements through state-of-the-art model combinations and the surface water-tailored design; and 3) unlike conventional methods, which usually require parameterization in accordance with the specific surface environment, trained WatNet can be directly applied for highly accurate surface water mapping, and, thus, no human labor is required. © 2021 The Authors

AB  - The involvement of people and technical devices is a characteristic feature of technological processes in agriculture. Human access to modernized and more efficient technical equipment determines the differentiation of the proportions of the contributions of human labor and technical equipment to the implementation of production technology on farms. Taking into account the data on manual and machine work inputs, the methodology of determining the technological index level (TL ) was presented. The aim of the present study was to present the scope of use of the technological index level to assess the effects of technological progress in the dairy production system, with particular emphasis on cow milking. For the value range of the technological index level (0–100%), changes in the milkman’s work efficiency were presented based on research carried out on farms equipped with milking equipment at different levels of technical advancement. Moreover, the course of changes in electricity and water consumption per liter of milk was determined in association with the technological index level. The issue of simultaneous implementation of various forms of progress was developed based on the example of milking cows with a milking robot. Five categories (ranges) of cows’ milk yield were distinguished and compared with the current yields of cows in the European Union. On this basis, a discussion was initiated on the factors that facilitate and limit the implementation of technical and technological progress in dairy production. © 2021 by the author.

AB  - As the prevalence of diabetes increases, millions of people need to be screened for diabetic retinopathy (DR). Remarkable advances in technology have made it possible to use artificial intelligence to screen DR from retinal images with high accuracy and reliability, resulting in reducing human labor by processing large amounts of data in a shorter time. We developed a fully automated classification algorithm to diagnose DR and identify referable status using optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) images with convolutional neural network (CNN) model and verified its feasibility by comparing its performance with that of conventional machine learning model. Ground truths for classifications were made based on ultra-widefield fluorescein angiography to increase the accuracy of data annotation. The proposed CNN classifier achieved an accuracy of 91–98%, a sensitivity of 86–97%, a specificity of 94–99%, and an area under the curve of 0.919–0.976. In the external validation, overall similar performances were also achieved. The results were similar regardless of the size and depth of the OCTA images, indicating that DR could be satisfactorily classified even with images comprising narrow area of the macular region and a single image slab of retina. The CNN-based classification using OCTA is expected to create a novel diagnostic workflow for DR detection and referral. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - In recent years, the technology-driven industrial upgrading in China has resulted in human labor being replaced with robots. This article explores the impact of "intelligent manufacturing" on workers from the following two perspectives: labor relations and the labor process. The authors argue that workers on the shopfloor are experiencing some forms of labor degradation due to robotization, i.e., more flexible labor relations, deskilling, and strengthened technical control. Such a corporation-led and machine-centered industrial upgrading is driven by state policy, capital, and the labor market. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Roller bearing failure is one of the most common faults in rotating machines. Various techniques for bearing fault diagnosis based on faults feature extraction have been proposed. But feature extraction from fault signals requires expert prior information and human labour. Recently, deep learning algorithms have been applied extensively in the condition monitoring of rotating machines to learn features automatically from the input data. Given its robust performance in image recognition, the convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture has been widely used to learn automatically discriminative features from vibration images and classify health conditions. This paper proposes and evaluates a two-stage method RGBVI-CNN for roller bearings fault diagnosis. The first stage in the proposed method is to generate the RGB vibration images (RGBVIs) from the input vibration signals. To begin this process, first, the 1-D vibration signals were converted to 2-D grayscale vibration Images. Once the conversion was completed, the regions of interest (ROI) were found in the converted 2-D grayscale vibration images. Finally, to produce vibration images with more discriminative characteristics, an algorithm was applied to the 2-D grayscale vibration images to produce connected components-based RGB vibration images (RGBVIs) with sets of colours and texture features. In the second stage, with these RGBVIs a CNN-based architecture was employed to learn automatically features from the RGBVIs and to classify bearing health conditions. Two cases of fault classification of rolling element bearings are used to validate the proposed method. Experimental results of this investigation demonstrate that RGBVI-CNN can generate advantageous health condition features from bearing vibration signals and classify the health conditions under different working loads with high accuracy. Moreover, several classification models trained using RGBVI-CNN offered high performance in the testing results of the overall classification accuracy, precision, recall, and F-score. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Purpose: Owing to the uneven distribution of annotated corpus among different languages, it is necessary to bridge the gap between low resource languages and high resource languages. From the perspective of entity relation extraction, this paper aims to extend the knowledge acquisition task from a single language context to a cross-lingual context, and to improve the relation extraction performance for low resource languages. Design/methodology/approach: This paper proposes a cross-lingual adversarial relation extraction (CLARE) framework, which decomposes cross-lingual relation extraction into parallel corpus acquisition and adversarial adaptation relation extraction. Based on the proposed framework, this paper conducts extensive experiments in two tasks, i.e. the English-to-Chinese and the English-to-Arabic cross-lingual entity relation extraction. Findings: The Macro-F1 values of the optimal models in the two tasks are 0.880 1 and 0.789 9, respectively, indicating that the proposed CLARE framework for CLARE can significantly improve the effect of low resource language entity relation extraction. The experimental results suggest that the proposed framework can effectively transfer the corpus as well as the annotated tags from English to Chinese and Arabic. This study reveals that the proposed approach is less human labour intensive and more effective in the cross-lingual entity relation extraction than the manual method. It shows that this approach has high generalizability among different languages. Originality/value: The research results are of great significance for improving the performance of the cross-lingual knowledge acquisition. The cross-lingual transfer may greatly reduce the time and cost of the manual construction of the multi-lingual corpus. It sheds light on the knowledge acquisition and organization from the unstructured text in the era of big data. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Humans are currently experiencing the fourth industrial revolution called Industry 4.0. This revolution came about with the arrival of new technologies that promise to change the way humans work and interact with each other and with machines. It aims to improve the cooperation between humans and machines for mutual enrichment. This would be done by leveraging human knowledge and experience, and by reactively balancing some complex or complicated tasks with intelligent systems. To achieve this objective, methodological approaches based on experimental studies should be followed to ensure a proper evaluation of human-machine system design choices. This paper proposes an experimental study based on a platform that uses an intelligent manufacturing system made up of mobile robots, autonomous shuttles using the principle of intelligent products, and manufacturing robots in the context of Manufacturing 4.0. Two experiments were conducted to evaluate the impact of teamwork human-machine cooperation, performance, and workload of the human operator. The results showed a lower level of participants’ assessment of time demand and physical demand in teamwork conditions. It was also found that the team working improves the subjective human operator Know-how-to-cooperate when controlling the autonomous shuttles. Moreover, the results showed that in addition to the work organization, other personal parameters, such as the frequency of playing video games could affect the performance and state of the human operator. They raised the importance of further analysis to determine cooperative patterns in a group of humans that can be adapted to improve human-machine cooperation. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - The remarkable capacities of AI-infused and data intensive systems are regularly presented as emblematic of technoscientific innovation and progress. Far less recognised is the human labour required to sift through and sort data, and ultimately train these systems. This is a labour distributed well beyond the presumed centres of technological innovation, and spun into and strewn across geographically distributed regions in the "Global South". This workshop brings together scholars and practitioners interested in and conducting research on the hidden labours that lie behind AI and data intensive systems. Participants will share perspectives or results of their research and, through highly exploratory engagements and dialogues, set out a critical mode of inquiry for future directions in research, design and policy. © 2021 ACM.

AB  - Recent advances in machine learning and computer vision brought to light technologies and algorithms that serve as new opportunities for creating intelligent and efficient manufacturing systems. In this study, the real-time monitoring system of manufacturing workflow for the Smart Connected Worker (SCW) is developed for the small and medium-sized manufacturers (SMMs), which integrates state-of-the-art machine learning techniques with the workplace scenarios of advanced manufacturing systems. Specifically, object detection and text recognition models are investigated and adopted to ameliorate the labor-intensive machine state monitoring process, while artificial neural networks are introduced to enable real-time energy disaggregation for further optimization. The developed system achieved efficient supervision and accurate information analysis in real-time for prolonged working conditions, which could effectively reduce the cost related to human labor, as well as provide an affordable solution for SMMs. The competent experiment results also demonstrated the feasibility and effectiveness of integrating machine learning technologies into the realm of advanced manufacturing systems. © 2021 The Author(s)

AB  - Post tsunami, the authorities still highly dependent on human labor in most of the search and rescue processes, while at the same time, the lives of the rescuers are also at stake and extremely crucial to avoid the further accident. Based on these conditions, the assistance of disaster robots is highly needed, which capable of operating in the unknown disaster area. This research presents an implementation of 2D local aerial path planning with obstacle avoidance for quadcopter as an aerial disaster robot. The research is divided into 2 different approaches, simulation, and prototype implementation. The simulation of aerial path planning algorithm utilized RViz 3D visualization tool for ROS Melodic Morenia on Ubuntu 18.04. The prototype quadcopter robot implementation combines the utilization of X-type frame mechanics, Pixhawk flight controller, DroneKit-Python software API, and VL53L0X Lidars as laser distance sensors facing in 5 sides around the quadcopter. In both approaches, laser distance sensor readings are processed into a histogram as basis data for the local path planning algorithm. Vector Field Histogram + algorithm is utilized to determine the path taken and obstacle avoidance maneuver. The research result targets are simulation and prototype implementation of the proposed aerial path planning algorithm. It is proven with the curving flight trajectory of the quadcopter when flying to the given waypoint while avoiding obstacles along the way. Different cost function adjustments of the aerial path planning algorithm resulted in different motion responses of the quadcopter robot while avoiding obstacles along the way to the given waypoint. The higher the safety distance and turning radius variables, the more responsive the motion of the quadcopter robot while avoiding obstacles and vice versa. © 2021 Author(s).

AB  - Question answering (QA) is a hot field of research in Natural Language Processing. A big challenge in this field is to answer questions from knowledge-dependable domain. Since traditional QA hardly satisfies some knowledge-dependable situations, such as disease diagnosis, drug recommendation, etc. In recent years, researches focus on knowledge-based question answering (KBQA). However, there still exist some problems in KBQA, traditional KBQA is limited by a range of historical cases and takes too much human labor. To address the problems, in this paper, we propose an approach of knowledge graph based question answering (KGQA) method for medical domain, which firstly constructs a medical knowledge graph by extracting named entities and relations between the entities from medical documents. Then, in order to understand a question, it extracts the key information in the question according to the named entities, and meanwhile, it recognizes the questions’ intentions by adopting information gain. The next an inference method based on weighted path ranking on the knowledge graph is proposed to score the related entities according to the key information and intention of a given question. Finally, it extracts the inferred candidate entities to construct answers. Our approach can understand questions, connect the questions to the knowledge graph and inference the answers on the knowledge graph. Theoretical analysis and real-life experimental results show the efficiency of our approach. © 2021. Huang et al.

AB  - Background: In the case of Korean institutions and enterprises that collect nonstandardized and nonunified formats of electronic medical examination results from multiple medical institutions, a group of experienced nurses who can understand the results and related contexts initially classified the reports manually. The classification guidelines were established by years of workers' clinical experiences and there were attempts to automate the classification work. However, there have been problems in which rule-based algorithms or human labor-intensive efforts can be time-consuming or limited owing to high potential errors. We investigated natural language processing (NLP) architectures and proposed ensemble models to create automated classifiers. Objective: This study aimed to develop practical deep learning models with electronic medical records from 284 health care institutions and open-source corpus data sets for automatically classifying 3 thyroid conditions: healthy, caution required, and critical. The primary goal is to increase the overall accuracy of the classification, yet there are practical and industrial needs to correctly predict healthy (negative) thyroid condition data, which are mostly medical examination results, and minimize false-negative rates under the prediction of healthy thyroid conditions. Methods: The data sets included thyroid and comprehensive medical examination reports. The textual data are not only documented in fully complete sentences but also written in lists of words or phrases. Therefore, we propose static and contextualized ensemble NLP network (SCENT) systems to successfully reflect static and contextual information and handle incomplete sentences. We prepared each convolution neural network (CNN)-, long short-term memory (LSTM)-, and efficiently learning an encoder that classifies token replacements accurately (ELECTRA)-based ensemble model by training or fine-tuning them multiple times. Through comprehensive experiments, we propose 2 versions of ensemble models, SCENT-v1 and SCENT-v2, with the single-architecture-based CNN, LSTM, and ELECTRA ensemble models for the best classification performance and practical use, respectively. SCENT-v1 is an ensemble of CNN and ELECTRA ensemble models, and SCENT-v2 is a hierarchical ensemble of CNN, LSTM, and ELECTRA ensemble models. SCENT-v2 first classifies the 3 labels using an ELECTRA ensemble model and then reclassifies them using an ensemble model of CNN and LSTM if the ELECTRA ensemble model predicted them as "healthy"labels. Results: SCENT-v1 outperformed all the suggested models, with the highest F1 score (92.56%). SCENT-v2 had the second-highest recall value (94.44%) and the fewest misclassifications for caution-required thyroid condition while maintaining 0 classification error for the critical thyroid condition under the prediction of the healthy thyroid condition. Conclusions: The proposed SCENT demonstrates good classification performance despite the unique characteristics of the Korean language and problems of data lack and imbalance, especially for the extremely low amount of critical condition data. The result of SCENT-v1 indicates that different perspectives of static and contextual input token representations can enhance classification performance. SCENT-v2 has a strong impact on the prediction of healthy thyroid conditions. © 2021 Dongyup Shin, Hye Jin Kam, Min-Seok Jeon, Ha Young Kim.

AB  - Population aging has become a major problem in developed countries. As the labor force declines, robot arms are expected to replace human labor for sim-ple tasks. A robotic arm attaches a tool specialized for a task and acquires the movement through teaching by an engineer with expert knowledge. However, the number of such engineers is limited; therefore, a teaching method that can be used by non-technical personnel is necessitated. As a teaching method, deep learning can be used to imitate human behavior and tool usage. However, deep learning requires a large amount of training data for learning. In this study, the target task of the robot is to sweep multiple pieces of dirt using a broom. The proposed learning system can estimate the initial parameters for deep learning based on experience, as well as the shape and physical prop-erties of the tools. It can reduce the number of training data points when learning a new tool. A virtual reality system is used to move the robot arm easily and safely, as well as to create training data for imitation. In this study, cleaning experiments are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The experimental results confirm that the proposed method can accelerate the learning speed of deep learning and ac-quire cleaning ability using a small amount of training data. © Fuji Technology Press Ltd.

AB  - This research illustrates the technical efficiency of the pan‐India paddy cultivation status obtained through a stochastic frontier approach. The results suggest that the mean technical efficiency varies from 0.64 in Gujarat to 0.95 in Odisha. Inputs like human labor, mechanical labor, fertilizer, irrigation and insecticide were found to determine the yield in paddy cultivation across India (except for Chhattisgarh). Inefficiency in the paddy production in Punjab, Bihar, West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Assam, Gujarat and Odisha in 2016–2017 was caused by technical inefficiency due to poor input management, as suggested by the significant σ2U and σ2v values of the stochastic frontier model. In addition, most of the farm groups in the study operated in the high‐efficiency group (80–90% technical efficiency). No specific pattern of input use can be visualized through descriptive measures to give any specific policy implication. Thus, machine learning algorithms based on the input parameters were tested on the data in order to predict the farmers’ efficiency class for individual states. The highest mean accuracy of 0.80 for the models of all of the states was achieved in random forest models. Among the various states of India, the best random forest prediction model based on accuracy was fitted to the input data of Bihar (0.91), followed by Uttar Pradesh (0.89), Andhra Pradesh (0.88), Assam (0.88) and West Bengal (0.86). Thus, the study provides a technique for the classification and prediction of a farmer’s efficiency group from the levels of input use in paddy cultivation for each state in the study. The study uses the DES input dataset to classify and predict the efficiency group of the farmer, as other machine learning models in agriculture have used mostly satellite, spectral imaging and soil property data to detect disease, weeds and crops. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - In the food industry, determining fruit maturity is very important to obtain fruit of good quality. The ripeness of some fruits can be determined by the color of the skin. Like several other types of fruit, the skin color can be used to determine the ripeness of Ambarella fruit. However, determining the ripeness of Ambarella fruit is still done manually by human labor, which is considered time-consuming, tiring, requires a lot of workers, and can cause inconsistencies. The development of technology such as computer vision allows the determination of fruit ripeness to be carried out automatically, accurate- ly, and relatively quickly. This study aims to classify the ripeness of the Ambarella fruit based on its color feature with the use of machine learning. The color features used are RGB, HSV, and L∗a∗b∗, with Support Vector Machine (SVM) and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) as the classifiers. Segmentation was done using the Otsu method. Google Colab, OpenCV, and scikit-learn are utilized in carrying out the experiments. The performance result shows that the highest accuracy, precision, recall, and f-measure were achieved by using SVM on the L∗a∗b∗ color feature. © 2021 ICIC International. All rights reserved.

AB  - Focusing on the self-accumulation ability and the nonrival characteristic of artificial intelligence (AI), this paper develops a three-sector endogenous growth model and investigates the impact of the development of AI along the transitional dynamics path and the balanced growth path. The development of AI can increase economic growth along the transitional dynamics path, and can increase household short-run utility if an increase in the accumulation of AI is due to the rising productivity in the goods or AI sector, but can be detrimental to household short-run utility if an increase in the accumulation of AI is because firms use more AI to replace human labor. In addition, the development of AI is not necessarily beneficial to household welfare in the long run. The main results are unaffected when considering the case where AI can improve the accumulation of human capital, the traditional research and development model, and different kinds of physical capital. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The automation of document processing has recently gained attention owing to its great potential to reduce manual work. Any improvement in information extraction systems or reduction in their error rates aids companies working with business documents because lowering reliance on cost-heavy and error-prone human work significantly improves the revenue. Neural networks have been applied to this area before, but they have been trained only on relatively small datasets with hundreds of documents so far. To successfully explore deep learning techniques and improve information extraction, we compiled a dataset with more than 25,000 documents. We expand on our previous work in which we proved that convolutions, graph convolutions, and self-attention can work together and exploit all the information within a structured document. Taking the fully trainable method one step further, we now design and examine various approaches to using Siamese networks, concepts of similarity, one-shot learning, and context/memory awareness. The aim is to improve micro F1 of per-word classification in the huge real-world document dataset. The results verify that trainable access to a similar (yet still different) page, together with its already known target information, improves the information extraction. The experiments confirm that all proposed architecture parts (Siamese networks, employing class information, query-answer attention module and skip connections to a similar page) are all required to beat the previous results. The best model yields an 8.25% gain in the F1 score over the previous state-of-the-art results. Qualitative analysis verifies that the new model performs better for all target classes. Additionally, multiple structural observations about the causes of the underperformance of some architectures are revealed, since all the techniques used in this work are not problem-specific and can be generalized for other tasks and contexts. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Near-ground sensing data, such as geospatial measurements of soil apparent electrical conductivity (ECa), are used in precision agriculture to improve farming practices and increase crop yield. Near-ground sensors provide valuable information, yet, the process of collecting, assessing, and interpreting measurements requires significant human labor. Automating parts of this process via the use of mobile robots can help decrease labor burden, and increase the accuracy and frequency of data collections, and overall increase the adoption and use of ECa measurement technology. This paper introduces a roboticized means to autonomously perform geospatial ECa measurements and map soil moisture content in micro-irrigated orchard systems. We retrofit a small wheeled mobile robot with a small electromagnetic induction sensor by studying and taking into consideration the effect of the robot body to the sensor's readings, and develop a software stack to enable autonomous logging of geo-referenced measurements. The proposed roboticized ECa measurement method is evaluated by mapping a 50m\times 30m field against the baseline of human-conducted measurements obtained by walking the sensor in the same field and following the same path. Experimental testing reveals that our approach yields roboticized measurements comparable to human-conducted ones, despite the robot's small form factor. © 2021 IEEE.

AB  - Frequent inspections are essential for false ceilings to maintain the service infrastructures, such as mechanical, electrical, and plumbing, and the structure of false ceilings. Human-labor-based conventional inspection procedures for false ceilings suffer many shortcomings, including safety concerns. Thus, robot-aided solutions are demanded for false ceiling inspections similar to other building maintenance services. However, less work has been conducted on developing robot-aided solutions for false ceiling inspections. This paper proposes a novel design for a robot intended for false ceiling inspections named Falcon. The compact size and the tracked wheel design of the robot allow it to traverse obstacles such as runners and lighting fixtures. The robot’s ability to autonomously follow the perimeter of a false ceiling can improve the productivity of the inspection process since the heading of the robot often changes due to the nature of the terrain, and continuous heading correction is an overhead for a teleoperator. Therefore, a Perimeter-Following Controller (PFC) based on fuzzy logic was integrated into the robot. Experimental results obtained by deploying a prototype of the robot design to a false ceiling testbed confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed PFC in perimeter following and the robot’s features, such as the ability to traverse on runners and fixtures in a false ceiling. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Background and objective: Glaucoma is one of the major diseases that cause blindness, which is incurable and irreversible, and it is essential to detect glaucoma vision deficits in treatment and check the progression of vision disorders in advance. In order to minimize the risk of glaucoma, it is necessary not only to diagnose and observe glaucoma but also to predict prognosis via indicators from Visual Field (VF) tests. However, information from the VF test cannot be directly used in clinical studies because most medical institutions store VF test sheets in Portable Document Format (PDF) or image files in different standards. Methods: We developed AI-based real-time VF big data digitizing systems that digitalize VF test images in real-time in two ways; Semi-AI and Full-AI digitizer. The Semi-AI digitizer detects the VF text area with actual coordinates derived from mouse handler system. Full-AI digitizer detects the VF text area with Faster Region Based Convolutional Neural Networks (RCNN). After detecting the text area, both systems extract texts with Recurrent Neural Network based Optical Character Recognition. Semi-AI and Full-AI digitizer post-processes the extracted text results with in-system algorithm and out-of-system algorithm, respectively. Results: Both systems used 325,310 VF test sheets from a tertiary hospital and extracted a total of 5,530,270 texts. From the 100 randomly selected VF sheets, 3,400 texts were used for the validation. Semi-AI and Full-AI digitizer showed 0.993 and 0.983 of accuracy, respectively. Conclusion: This study demonstrates the effectiveness of AI applications in detecting text areas and the different implementation methodologies of the post-processing process. In detecting text area, Semi-AI may be better than Full-AI digitizer in terms of system speed and human labor labeling if the number of types to be classified is small. However, Full-AI digitizer is recommended because it allows detecting text area regardless of resolution and size of the VF sheets, as the types of real-world VF test sheets cannot be predicted, and the types become more unpredictable when extended to multi-hospital studies. For Post-preprocessing, Semi-AI methodology is recommended because Semi-AI produced higher results with less effort and considered the convenience of researchers by implementing them as in-system. © 2021

AB  - The inaccuracy of anthropogenic emission inventories on a high-resolution scale due to insufficient basic data is one of the major reasons for the deviation between air quality model and observation results. A bottom-up approach, which is a typical emission inventory estimation method, requires a lot of human labor and material resources, whereas a top-down approach focuses on individual pollutants that can be measured directly as well as relying heavily on traditional numerical modeling. Lately, the deep neural network approach has achieved rapid development due to its high efficiency and nonlinear expression ability. In this study, we proposed a novel method to model the dual relationship between an emission inventory and pollution concentrations for emission inventory estimation. Specifically, we utilized a neural-network-based comprehensive chemical transport model (NN-CTM) to explore the complex correlation between emission and air pollution. We further updated the emission inventory based on back-propagating the gradient of the loss function measuring the deviation between NN-CTM and observations from surface monitors. We first mimicked the CTM model with neural networks (NNs) and achieved a relatively good representation of the CTM, with similarity reaching 95%. To reduce the gap between the CTM and observations, the NN model suggests updated emissions of NOx, NH3, SO2, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and primary PM2.5 changing, on average, by -1.34%, -2.65%, -11.66%, -19.19% and 3.51%, respectively, in China for 2015. Such ratios of NOx and PM2.5 are even higher (ĝ1/410%) in regions that suffer from large uncertainties in original emissions, such as Northwest China. The updated emission inventory can improve model performance and make it closer to observations. The mean absolute error for NO2, SO2, O3 and PM2.5 concentrations are reduced significantly (by about 10%-20%), indicating the high feasibility of NN-CTM in terms of significantly improving both the accuracy of the emission inventory and the performance of the air quality model. © 2021 Copernicus GmbH.

AB  - Future advances in AI that automate away human labor may have stark implications for labor markets and inequality. This paper proposes a framework to analyze the effects of specific types of AI systems on the labor market, based on how much labor demand they will create versus displace, while taking into account that productivity gains also make society wealthier and thereby contribute to additional labor demand. This analysis enables ethically-minded companies creating or deploying AI systems as well as researchers and policymakers to take into account the effects of their actions on labor markets and inequality, and therefore to steer progress in AI in a direction that advances shared prosperity and an inclusive economic future for all of humanity. © 2021 ACM.

AB  - The use of computer-mediated communication (CMC) has been ubiquitous in higher education. To better understand students' behaviors and facilitate students' learning through CMC, this study aimed to classify messages in Facebook learning group which was created as an on-line discussion board. Different machine learning and deep learning classification models were proposed, trained and testified with corpuses from PTT, one of the famous on-line forums in Taiwan. Furthermore, the classification of Facebook messages by these well-trained models were compared with human coding. Results revealed that recurrent neural network (RNN) with word to vector (W2V) for feature extraction demonstrated the best performance in accuracy. In addition, the combination of RNN and TF-IDF was proved to have the highest correlation with human work. Implications for artificial intelligence (AI) in education context was discussed. © 2021 IEEE.

AB  - In evaluating agricultural products, knowing the specific product varieties is important for the producer, the industrialist, and the consumer. Human labor is widely used in the classification of varieties. It is generally performed by visual examination of each sample by experts, which is very laborious and time-consuming with poor sensitivity. There is a need in commercial hazelnut production for a rapid, non-destructive and reliable variety classification in order to obtain quality nuts from the orchard to the consumer. In this study, a convolutional neural network, which is one of the deep learning methods, was preferred due to its success in computer vision. A total of 17 widely grown hazelnut varieties were classified. The proposed model was evaluated by comparing with pre-trained models. Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-Score evaluation metrics were used to determine the performance of classifiers. It was found that the proposed model showed a better performance than pre-trained models in terms of performance evaluation criteria. The proposed model was found to produce 98.63% accuracy in the test set, including 510 images. This result has shown that the proposed model can be used practically in the classification of hazelnut varieties. © 2021 by the authors Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - As part of the assumptions of Industry 4.0. many modern technologies are developing. One of them is robotic process automation (RPA). It allows the replacement of human labor with robots, thus increasing the production capacity of enterprises. In practice, the implementation of RPA takes place through two solutions (models): using the services of an external entity offering RPA (service insourcing) or creating your own center of excellence (CoE). The use of both solutions is influenced by numerous conditions (determinants), among which we can mention benefits on the one hand and threats on the other. They are very different and depend on the model used. In this article, attempts were made to identify and determine their impact on the selection of the appropriate model from the point of view of the company (the purpose of the article). The research used two cases of entities implementing RPA on the basis of opposites, i.e., two different models, in which the discussed technology is treated as an important element of their automation. The achieved results indicate that there is no universalism, and their dominant feature is individualism concerning both enterprises and the solutions they implement. This is undoubtedly the effect of the currently too shallow RPA market, as well as the small number of entities using technologies based on intelligent systems. This is a serious research gap, which along with RPA growth will be reduced as a result of more and more intensive research in this field. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - In seismic data processing, static corrections for near-surface velocities are derived from first-break picking. The quality of the static corrections is paramount to developing an accurate shallow velocity model, a model that in turn greatly impacts the subsequent seismic processing steps. Because even small errors in first-break picking can greatly impact the seismic velocity model building, it is necessary to pick high-quality traveltimes. Whereas various artificial intelligence-based methods have been proposed to automate the process for data with medium to high signal-to-noise ratio (S/N), these methods are not applicable to low-S/N data, which still require intensive labor from skilled operators. We successfully replace 160 hours of skilled human work with 10 hours of processing by a single NVIDIA Quadro P6000 graphical processing unit by reducing the number of human picks from the usual 5%-10% to 0.19% of available gathers. High-quality inferred picks are generated by convolutional neural network-based machine learning trained from the human picks. © 2021 Society of Exploration Geophysicists. All rights reserved.

AB  - Deep learning has already been successfully used in the development of decision support systems in various domains. Therefore, there is an incentive to apply it in other important domains such as agriculture. Fertilizers, electricity, chemicals, human labor, and water are the components of total energy consumption in agriculture. Yield estimates are critical for food security, crop management, irrigation scheduling, and estimating labor requirements for harvesting and storage. Therefore, estimating product yield can reduce energy consumption. Two deep learning models, Long Short-Term Memory and Gated Recurrent Units, have been developed for the analysis of time-series data such as agricultural datasets. In this paper, the capabilities of these models and their extensions, called Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory and Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Units, to predict end-of-season yields are investigated. The models use historical data, including climate data, irrigation scheduling, and soil water content, to estimate end-of-season yield. The application of this technique was tested for tomato and potato yields at a site in Portugal. The Bidirectional Long Short-Term memory outperformed the Gated Recurrent Units network, the Long Short-Term Memory, and the Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Units network on the validation dataset. The model was able to capture the nonlinear relationship between irrigation amount, climate data, and soil water content and predict yield with an MSE of 0.017 to 0.039. The performance of the Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory in the test was compared with the most commonly used deep learning method, the Convolutional Neural Network, and machine learning methods including a Multi-Layer Perceptrons model and Random Forest Regression. The Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory outperformed the other models with an R2 score between 0.97 and 0.99. The results show that analyzing agricultural data with the Long Short-Term Memory model improves the performance of the model in terms of accuracy. The Convolutional Neural Network model achieved the second-best performance. Therefore, the deep learning model has a remarkable ability to predict the yield at the end of the season. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - The cultivation of apples and pears in orchards consists of several tasks that still demand much human labor. The cost of this skilled labor increases while the number of competent seasonal workers becomes insufficient. These facts are a threat to the fruit industry. To find a solution, this paper addresses current as well as future automation possibilities for the main orchard tasks as a profitable alternative to human labor. Besides an activity research in pome fruit orchards, this paper contains an overall review of the research and developments that have been performed to automate each major activity (e.g., pruning, thinning, spraying, harvesting and mobile navigating) in the cultivation of pome fruit. These tasks are individually evaluated on feasibility and profitability of the developed automations. Finally, this paper concludes that, despite the large amount of research, almost no fully automated and cost-efficient solution has been developed. A possible option to increase the viability of the prototypes might be the simplification of the tree structures, and consequently the orchard architecture, to make it “robot-ready.” Another option in this perspective is combining several techniques, for accomplishing individual tasks, in one multipurpose robot platform. As a result, the usability and efficiency of the robot increases. © 2020 The Authors. Journal of Field Robotics published by Wiley Periodicals LLC

AB  - With the development of artificial intelligence industry, it is more and more popular to combine deep learning technology with machine fault diagnosis recent years. The process of fault diagnosis includes two main steps: extracting fault features from signals and classify the health conditions based on the features. In traditional diagnosis methods, features extraction depends on human labor and prior knowledge so much, which makes the processes of fault diagnosis not only time-consuming and laborious, but also subjective and limited. According to the theory of unsupervised learning, a method for intelligent diagnosis of motor bearing is proposed in this paper. Firstly, wavelet packet analysis(WPA) is used to reduce noise by decomposing and reconstructing the original signal. Then, sparse filtering network is used to extract features from decomposed signals. Finally, according to the extracted features, support vector machine is used to classify the health conditions. The results show that the proposed method is more accurate than other related methods. Because of unsupervised learning, the proposed method depends on human labor and prior knowledge rarely. © 2021 IEEE.

AB  - Road landmark inventory is becoming an important data product for the maintenance of transport infrastructures. Several commercial sensors are available which include synchronized optical cameras that allowto build 360° panoramic images of the surroundings of the vehicle used for road inspection. This paper is devoted to the analysis of such panorama images,specifically the area that contains themost relevant information. Road lane landmark detection is posed as a two class classification problem that may be solved bymachine learningapproaches, such as Random Forest (RF) and ensembles of Extreme Learning Machines (V-ELM). Besides model parameter selection, a central problem is the construction of a labeled training and validation datasetto cope with the highly uncontrolled conditions of image capture. Besides, human labor cost makes image data labeling a very expensive process. This paper proposes an open ended Active Learning (AL) approach involving a human oraclein the loop who provides the data labeling and can trigger the AL process when detection quality is degraded by the change in imaging conditions. The paper reports encouraging results over a collection of sample images selected from an industrial road landmark inventory operation. As an additional contribution, this paper assesses the ability of AL to overcomesome of the issues raised by highly class imbalanced datasets. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In the modern world, mental health disorder is one of the serious problems for every nation around the globe, especially in this Covid-19 pandemic period. These illnesses affect not only patient's mental health but also physical health, thus, reduce productivity and quality of human work. Mental health disorder is complex and also takes many forms. In this study, we pay attention to depression (unipolar and bipolar) illness. We conducted our experiment on the open dataset named Depresjon, which was collected from activity motion signals on wearable devices of 32 healthy people and 23 depressed (unipolar and bipolar) patients over several days in a row with a total of 814 samples. Firstly, we did the preprocessing data step in order to make the dataset fitting the DL model input. After that, we deployed many individual DL models to make the first predictions. Next, we generated Deep Stacked Generalization Ensemble Learning (DeSGEL) models which were able to learn how to make the best combination of predictions from previous individual well-trained models. Finally, we made a comparison among the individual and the proposed DeSGEL models. The results showed that the DeSGEL models had outperformed other corresponding individual models. Specifically, among the individual models, VGG16 had the best performance. However, the DeSGEL Resnet based showed an extremely outstanding performance over other individual and ensemble DL models. In detail, these models had Accuracy, Precision, Sensitivity, Specification, F1 score, MCC and AUC of 0.94, 0.91, 0.89, 0.96, 0.90, 0.85 and 0.92 respectively for Individual VGG16 model, and 0.96, 0.96, 0.92, 0.98, 0.94, 0.91 and 0.95 respectively for the DeSGEL Resnet based model. We found that applying Deep learning, especially DeSGEL models using activity motion signal data from wearable devices could be a prospective direction for the early diagnosis of mental health disorders. © 2021 ACM.

AB  - Background: When exposed to repetitive umbilical cord occlusions (UCO) with worsening acidemia, fetuses eventually develop cardiovascular decompensation manifesting as pathological hypotensive arterial blood pressure (ABP) responses to fetal heart rate (FHR) decelerations. Failure to maintain cardiac output during labor is a key event leading up to brain injury. We reported that the timing of the event when a fetus begins to exhibit this cardiovascular phenotype is highly individual and was impossible to predict. Objective: We hypothesized that this phenotype would be reflected in the individual behavior of heart rate variability (HRV) as measured by root mean square of successive differences of R-R intervals (RMSSD), a measure of vagal modulation of HRV, which is known to increase with worsening acidemia. This is clinically relevant because HRV can be computed in real-time intrapartum. Consequently, we aimed to predict the individual timing of the event when a hypotensive ABP pattern would emerge in a fetus from a series of continuous RMSSD data. Study Design: Fourteen near-term fetal sheep were chronically instrumented with vascular catheters to record fetal arterial blood pressure, umbilical cord occluder to mimic uterine contractions occurring during human labor and ECG electrodes to compute the ECG-derived HRV measure RMSSD. All animals were studied over a ~6 h period. After a 1–2 h baseline control period, the animals underwent mild, moderate, and severe series of repetitive UCO. We applied the recently developed machine learning algorithm to detect physiologically meaningful changes in RMSSD dynamics with worsening acidemia and hypotensive responses to FHR decelerations. To mimic clinical scenarios using an ultrasound-based 4 Hz FHR sampling rate, we recomputed RMSSD from FHR sampled at 4 Hz and compared the performance of our algorithm under both conditions (1,000 Hz vs. 4 Hz). Results: The RMSSD values were highly non-stationary, with four different regimes and three regime changes, corresponding to a baseline period followed by mild, moderate, and severe UCO series. Each time series was characterized by seemingly randomly occurring (in terms of timing of the individual onset) increase in RMSSD values at different time points during the moderate UCO series and at the start of the severe UCO series. This event manifested as an increasing trend in RMSSD values, which counter-intuitively emerged as a period of relative stationarity for the time series. Our algorithm identified these change points as the individual time points of cardiovascular decompensation with 92% sensitivity, 86% accuracy and 92% precision which corresponded to 14 ± 21 min before the visual identification. In the 4 Hz RMSSD time series, the algorithm detected the event with 3 times earlier detection times than at 1,000 Hz, i.e., producing false positive alarms with 50% sensitivity, 21% accuracy, and 27% precision. We identified the overestimation of baseline FHR variability by RMSSD at a 4 Hz sampling rate to be the cause of this phenomenon. Conclusions: The key finding is demonstration of FHR monitoring to detect fetal cardiovascular decompensation during labor. This validates the hypothesis that our HRV-based algorithm identifies individual time points of ABP responses to UCO with worsening acidemia by extracting change point information from the physiologically related fluctuations in the RMSSD signal. This performance depends on the acquisition accuracy of beat to beat fluctuations achieved in trans-abdominal ECG devices and fails at the sampling rate used clinically in ultrasound-based systems. This has implications for implementing such an approach in clinical practice. © Copyright © 2021 Gold, Herry, Wang and Frasch.

AB  - The emergence of intelligent mobile robots has liberated the human labor to a certain extent, especially their abilities to work in harsh environments in place of humans. For intelligent mobile robots, how to achieve fast path optimization is an important issue. In this article, the model establishment method of environmental information collected by robot sensors and the genetic algorithm for real-time optimization of running paths are briefly introduced first, the crossover, mutation probability, and fitness function are improved based on the shortcomings of the traditional genetic algorithm, and then the simulation analysis of the two algorithms is carried out using matrix laboratory (MATLAB) software. The results show that the improved algorithm obtains a smaller length of optimal path, fewer inflection points, and a smaller turning angle, which also converges faster and has a greater degree of fitness. It takes 0.053 s for the traditional algorithm to calculate the optimal path, while the improved algorithm needs 0.013 s. In summary, the improved genetic algorithm can quickly and efficiently calculate the optimal path, which is suitable for real-time path optimization of mobile robots. © IMechE 2020.

AB  - Against the background of the new era, the birth of artificial intelligence technology opened a new chapter in human development. Artificial intelligence technology has been developed in many places. The report discusses the application and innovation of artificial intelligence technology in college sports. The first thing people think of artificial intelligence is robots. In fact, it can be said that artificial intelligence can replace human labor. Artificial intelligence is a product of modern technology and cannot be understood unilaterally. For example, the various means of transportation used in people's daily travel is an artificial intelligence that can replace people's walking. Another example is that elevators can replace people on stairs. It is also a type of artificial intelligence, which is not an advanced technology. Product, it is also seen everywhere in people's daily life. Artificial intelligence is a synthesis of scientific and intelligent technology created by human beings. It is a scientific technology including computer science, cognition, logic, etc., formed through mutual intersection and integration. In recent years, artificial intelligence has achieved considerable development, but there are still a series of unsolved problems, and the development of artificial intelligence is still very long. This article studies what artificial intelligence has facilitated and changed the physical education in colleges and universities, and what changes have taken place in the teaching mode are all worthy of our thinking. As a result, artificial intelligence technology is convenient for teachers and students in teaching. Let's take a look at how to innovate. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - The food industry is dependent on human labor for tasks that require tactile sensing, due in part to a lack of robotic sensors that are delicate enough to interact with food. In this paper we present the design, modeling, and performance of a durometer constructed with soft materials. We performed experiments to investigate the sensor's material selection, repeatability, drift, probing speed, and calibration. We also integrated the sensor into a commercial soft robotic gripper and used it to measure the hardness of an orange. The orange would be damaged by a traditional durometer, but the soft durometer left no visible marks. These results suggest that soft robotic sensors can benefit the food industry and overcome limitations associated with the interaction between robotic systems and fragile objects. © 2021 IEEE.

AB  - Checking, assortment and removal of trash squander is considered as one of the main points of contention in the evolving modern society since its lack of maintenance will leverage negative ecological effects. A dreary technique is the traditional method used for physically controlling and gathering the waste, since it requires a critical human work and assets, which adds greater expenses. An IoT-based trash checking system utilizing Arduino or Raspberry pi board and an open IoT stage is presented in this report. The proposed framework includes an Arduino microcontroller, ultrasonic sensor, Wi-Fi module and a heap battery. Information from the ultrasonic sensor and burden cell is obtained by using the Arduino microcontroller. By utilizing an ultrasonic sensor, the profundity of the trash in the compartment is resolved and the heaviness of the waste receptacle from the heap cell is also estimated. For indicating the information, the LCD screen is utilized. The Wi-Fi module sends to the web the information portrayed previously. Thingspeak and an open IoT discussion is utilized to follow the trash framework. In this framework, the executive can adequately track and plan the waste disposal. In this research work, a model was fabricated and assessed. © 2021 IEEE.

AB  - Purpose: The objective of this paper was to develop a computer-aided diagnostic (CAD) tools for automated analysis of capsule endoscopic (CE) images, more precisely, detect small intestinal abnormalities like bleeding. Methods: In particular, we explore a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based deep learning framework to identify bleeding and non-bleeding CE images, where a pre-trained AlexNet neural network is used to train a transfer learning CNN that carries out the identification. Moreover, bleeding zones in a bleeding-identified image are also delineated using deep learning-based semantic segmentation that leverages a SegNet deep neural network. Results: To evaluate the performance of the proposed framework, we carry out experiments on two publicly available clinical datasets and achieve a 98.49% and 88.39% F1 score, respectively, on the capsule endoscopy.org and KID datasets. For bleeding zone identification, 94.42% global accuracy and 90.69% weighted intersection over union (IoU) are achieved. Conclusion: Finally, our performance results are compared to other recently developed state-of-the-art methods, and consistent performance advances are demonstrated in terms of performance measures for bleeding image and bleeding zone detection. Relative to the present and established practice of manual inspection and annotation of CE images by a physician, our framework enables considerable annotation time and human labor savings in bleeding detection in CE images, while providing the additional benefits of bleeding zone delineation and increased detection accuracy. Moreover, the overall cost of CE enabled by our framework will also be much lower due to the reduction of manual labor, which can make CE affordable for a larger population. © 2021, Society for Imaging Informatics in Medicine.

AB  - Today's manufacturing industry still requires human labor and knowledge for Machining Process Identification (MPI). Before manufacturing a part, engineers need to judge the manufacturability and identify the machining processes according to CAD model, and then the customer needs to source for qualified suppliers based on the identified machining processes. In order to realize an efficient automated industrial logistic system, developing a competent Machining Process Identification system becomes important. In this paper, a novel two-step MPI system is presented based on 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and transfer learning. The proposed system admits triangularly tessellated surface (STL) models as inputs and outputs the manufacturability of the CAD design and machining process labels (e.g., milling, turning) as the results of classification from the neural networks. Computer-synthesized workpiece models are utilized in training the networks. In addition to the MPI system, a pre-trained framework was developed for future applications in related fields. The MPI system shows more than 98% accuracy in identifying manufacturability of a part and about 98% accuracy in identifying the manufacturing processes of synthesized workpiece models which validates the robustness of the model. © 2021 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers

AB  - Tree counting plays an important role in wide applications of environmental protection, agricultural planning and crop yield estimation. However, traditional tree counting methods require expensive feature engineering, which causes additional mistake and cannot be optimized overall. Recently, deep learning based approaches have been adopted for this task which demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. In this paper, a point-wise supervised segmentation network is proposed based on a deep segmentation network with only weak supervision, which can complete localization and generate mask of each tree simultaneously. In the first step, a tree feature extractor module is adopted to extract features of input images with a novel encoder–decoder network. In the second step, an effective strategy is designed to deal with different conditions with mask predictions. Finally, the basic localization and rectification guidance are introduced to train the whole network. In addition, two different datasets are created and an existing challenging plant dataset is selected to evaluate the proposed method. Experimental results on those datasets show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in most challenging conditions. This method has great potential to reduce human labor due to effective automatic generated masks. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Ball bonding inspections with human vision are essential in manufacturing processes of semiconductors devices and integrated circuits (ICs). The inspections are an intensive task which involves human labours to detect poor bonds. Prolonged visual inspections cause poor inspection integrity due to eye-fatigue. However, inspections nowadays are mostly conducted manually by humans which cannot satisfy the demanding productions. Motivated by the extraordinary performance of machine learning for manufacturing inspections, a detection framework integrated with machine learning and human judgement is proposed to aid bonding inspections based on visual images. The detection framework is incorporated with the convolution neural network (CNN), support vector machine (SVM) and circle hough transform algorithm (CHT); human judgement is only used when the detection uncertainty is below the threshold. The novel machine learning integration is proposed on the detection framework to improve the generalization capabilities. The CNN architecture is redeveloped by incorporating with the SVM which is generally more effective than the fully connected network in the classical CNN. Also a novel training function is proposed based on the CHT to ensure the inspection reliability; the function not only takes into account real image captures, but also locates important features using pattern analysis of the ball bondings. Experimental results show that significantly better classifications can be achieved by the proposed framework compared with the classical CNN and other commonly used classifiers. Only the machine learning determinations below the threshold are reassessed by human judgements. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Hand gestures are a symbolic and non-vocal language and are used by an individual to communicate. With computer vision, hand gestures can be detected and be used to talk with a capable computer, leading to the field of Human-Computer interconnection. The field of computer vision has been achieving cutting edge results with the advent of deep learning models. The work implements the Inception v3 architecture [1], which is a convolutional neural network. The model is retrained on our data set using Transfer learning, with which we reduce the requirements on computational resources, data and time. In this project, a hand gesture is performed in front of a web camera of a system. The gestures are predicted as one among six gestures with a corresponding probability. This project deals with the applications of the detected hand gestures in home automation and control of a robotic arm. Hand gestures are simple to perform, and it makes managing home effortless compared to manually intervening and providing instructions to a machine. In the home automation model, the gesture classification results from the system are transmitted to the microcontroller which switches on or off a home device. The robotic arm is a mechanical system which is used in manipulating the movement of lifting, moving, and placing the workpiece to lighten the work of man. It is equipped with servo motors and is controlled by our hand gestures to perform lifting and dropping of objects and rotation of the robotic arm. © 2021 ACM.

AB  - Since fault diagnosis has entered the big data era, deep learning has been more and more widely studied to diagnose faults of rolling element bearings. Generally, existing methods require labeled data for training before they can be used to recognize faults. However, in real scenarios, massive data are usually unlabeled data rather than labeled ones, because labeling data is always a tough issue and consumes much human labor. In order to fully take advantage of the massive unlabeled data, this paper proposes a vibration indicator-based graph convolutional neural network (VI-GCN) for fault diagnosis. The VI-GCN is applied to a benchmark dataset of bearing faults. Experimental results indicate that it is promising for bearing fault diagnosis when there are few labeled data. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Implementing Industry 4.0 and interconnected robotization in industrial enterprises drifts towards occupational changes. Nowadays, the task is to create cooperation and collaboration between a robot and a human in a common robotized workplace so that it is safe and effective. The type of robot, the robotic device that works in collaboration with a human operator, is called a cobot. In the case of a closer interaction of the robot or cobot with humans, it is necessary to consider where it is possible to replace human work entirely or where it is possible to merely supplement it. The most socially acceptable option is the implementation of robots only for the performance of supplementary tasks, since the traditional work positions of people in manufacturing processes would remain largely preserved. On the other hand, workplace robotization is particularly suitable for work environments with hazardous chemical substances that are carcinogenic and toxic to humans. Similarly, robotization helps to improve workplace ergonomics and also to avoid, for humans, very laborious and often repetitive work. The SWOT analysis (analysis of Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats) was used as a relevant tool to assess various aspects of the impact of increasing robotization on working positions in industrial enterprises. SWOT analysis is an indicative assessment of the suitability of implementation of robots in a given workplace, which helps to create an optimal solution and indicate new areas of needed analysis and research directions. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - ConspectusData science has revolutionized chemical research and continues to break down barriers with new interdisciplinary studies. The introduction of computational models and machine learning (ML) algorithms in combination with automation and traditional experimental techniques has enabled scientific advancement across nearly every discipline of chemistry, from materials discovery, to process optimization, to synthesis planning. However, predictive tools powered by data science are only as good as their data sets and, currently, many of the data sets used to train models suffer from several limitations, including being sparse, limited in scope and requiring human curation. Likewise, computational data faces limitations in terms of accurate modeling of nonideal systems and can suffer from low translation fidelity from simulation to real conditions. The lack of diverse data and the need to be able to test it experimentally reduces both the accuracy and scope of the predictive models derived from data science. This Account contextualizes the need for more complex and diverse experimental data and highlights how the seamless integration of robotics, machine learning, and data-rich monitoring techniques can be used to access it with minimal human labor.We propose three broad categories of data in chemistry: Data on fundamental properties, data on reaction outcomes, and data on reaction mechanics. We highlight flexible, automated platforms that can be deployed to acquire and leverage these data. The first platform combines solid- A nd liquid-dosing modules with computer vision to automate solubility screening, thereby gathering fundamental data that are necessary for almost every experimental design. Using computer vision offers the additional benefit of creating a visual record, which can be referenced and used to further interrogate and gain insight on the data collected. The second platform iteratively tests reaction variables proposed by a ML algorithm in a closed-loop fashion. Experimental data related to reaction outcomes are fed back into the algorithm to drive the discovery and optimization of new materials and chemical processes. The third platform uses automated process analytical technology to gather real-time data related to reaction kinetics. This system allows the researcher to directly interrogate the reaction mechanisms in granular detail to determine exactly how and why a reaction proceeds, thereby enabling reaction optimization and deployment. © 2021 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Annotation. In most cases, multifunctional robots used both in industry and in the home environment to facilitate human labor have a common problem, which is a lack of autonomy and self-learning. This does not mean that it is impossible to implement self-learning within the operation of these machines, but most often such technical units function according to a specific algorithm, without deviating from its principles, even if this may lead to better results. First of all, a clear adherence to the program, in accordance with the acceptable quality of the final result, is put at the forefront. However, when working with technical units that do not depend on clear industrial or household algorithms, it is allowed to use an individual approach to the implementation of management processes. This work is devoted to the construction of the concept and principles of implementing voice control of a mobile robot for performing movement tasks. © 2021 Institute of Physics Publishing.

AB  - Continuous detection and efficient monitoring of Out-Of-Stock (OOS) of products in retail environments is a key factor to improve stores profits. Traditional methods require labour-intensive human work dedicated to checking for products to refill raising the requirement of automatic solutions to detect OOS. In this work, we focus on the problem of OOS detection from an egocentric perspective proposing a new weak annotation of the EgoCart dataset. We benchmark the considered challenge employing a deep learning approach for the detection of OOS areas. Specifically, we train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to predict attention maps useful to find OOS in retail areas and hence suggest the retail employers where to intervene. We evaluate results with both objective measures and a subjective analysis provided by human which has reviewed the obtained OOS attention maps. The achieved performance demonstrates that the proposed pipeline is promising to help the refilling process in the retail domain. © 2021 IEEE.

AB  - With the development of communication technology, many different kinds of media transmission have become popular. Among various media, video is the most popular media these days. However, users need to spend much time watching the whole video content. Due to the characteristics of video media, many users tend to playback video content quickly or even stop watching in the middle. Some websites provide summary images by capturing only important frames of video content, which is called a video summary. Users can shorten the viewing time by only watching the summary results. In particular, it is highly useful because content such as news articles or speeches can be delivered and utilized quickly. Since video summarization is a labor-intensive task, there is an increasing demand for research on automation techniques. In this paper, an automated process to solve the temporary problem of existing video summary techniques is proposed. The proposed method improves the existing video summarization methods that have been performed manually through human labor by developing artificial intelligence technology that can effectively perform content delivery using video summary automation. In the preprocessing process, the information transfer unit is partitioned using optical flow. In the following process, CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) is used as an in-depth learning method for feature extraction. The results show the efficiency of the proposed algorithm, and some future work will be given in the end. © 2021. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - Corporate Industries apply new technologies for manufacturing and production applications. This makes the process depend upon multiple computers, robotic applications, and varying specifications, which reduces efficiency and speed. These technological challenges are incredibly diverse since an extensive range of processing technologies is available. When it comes to human-centered automation, it's all about the scientific knowledge and data encapsulation for robots to interact within this field. Robots must operate in various ecosystems and interact closely with non-professional customers. Current technology is not well adapted to this scenario, requiring sustainable management separated from available technology. In this article, the human-centered Industrial Robot using Artificial Intelligence (AI-HCIR) is suggested as a tool to resolve such issues. Several manufacturing protocols are presented to efficiently produce products that simplify human work and involve different needs. The HCIR scrutinizes it for time allocation and manufacturing time allocation. For this, a suitable processing environment and a detailed simulation is conducted. The proposed AI-HCIR achieves a 33.68% error rate, 24% throughput, and 18.7% efficiency in the smart city environment. In contrast with conventional methods, the proposed method obtains a better result efficiently. © 2021 World Scientific Publishing Company.

AB  - Even though the ongoing digital transformation in the forms of artificial intelligence and robotics offer promising concepts on automating warehouse operations, a majority of processes in intralogistics rely on manual human work. Since order picking has been identified as the most labour-intensive, as well as costly activity in warehouses, forklift operators receive significantly less attention in research. To shed light on the cognitive aspects of forklift operators, this paper aspires to quantify the learning process for n = 5 forklift operators and mental fatigue effects for another n = 5 operators in a retail warehouse for cooled and perishable items. Our results indicate that learning, as well as fatigue effects, can be observed in this field of operations and are measurable through a multivariable parametric approach. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - The proliferation of the Internet and social media usage creates enormous textual data (specifically, news content) on the web. The most proportion of contents primarily are unstructured. Extracting meaningful insights from unstructured content is nearly impossible or extremely hard, and time-consuming by human labor. Thus, automatic text classification has gained much attention from NLP experts in recent years. Several techniques have been developed to classify news text in high resource languages (e.g., English, Chinese, French). However, the automatic classification of Bengali news text is in a primitive stage to date. This paper investigates the six most popular machine learning techniques (such as Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Classifier (SVC), Decision Tree (DT), Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB), Random Forest (RF), etc.) with Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) features for automatic sports news classification in Bengali. Due to the unavailability of benchmark corpus, this work also developed a Bengali news corpus (called BNeC) consisting of 43306 news documents with 202830 unique words in multiple classes: Cricket, Football, Tennis, and Athletics. Experimental results on the test dataset show that the Support Vector Classifier (SVC) with unigram+bigram+trigram feature space obtained the highest weighted f1-score of 97.60% than the other classifiers and feature combinations. © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - Automatically recommending relevant law articles to a given legal case has attracted much attention as it can greatly release human labor from searching over the large database of laws. However, current researches only support coarse-grained recommendation where all relevant articles are predicted as a whole without explaining which specific fact each article is relevant with. Since one case can be formed of many supporting facts, traversing over them to verify the correctness of recommendation results can be time-consuming. We believe that learning fine-grained correspondence between each single fact and law articles is crucial for an accurate and trustworthy AI system. With this motivation, we perform a pioneering study and create a corpus with manually annotated fact-article correspondences. We treat the learning as a text matching task and propose a multi-level matching network to address it. To help the model better digest the content of law articles, we parse articles in form of premise-conclusion pairs with random forest. Experiments show that the parsed form yielded better performance and the resulting model surpassed other popular text matching baselines. Furthermore, we compare with previous researches and find that establishing the fine-grained fact-article correspondences can improve the recommendation accuracy by a large margin. Our best system reaches an F1 score of 96.3%, making it of great potential for practical use. It can also significantly boost the downstream task of legal decision prediction, increasing the F1 score by up to 12.7%.

AB  - Background: Mega multinational companies are highly dependent on robots to handle the maximum of their machinery workload, which significantly reduces human labor and saves valuable time as well. However, as vital as the role of robots is, a much more challenging task is its selection. Moreover, the robots need to be evaluated on the grounds of different specifications and their ease of handling, which results in a smooth and work-efficient environment. Objective: The prime objective of this paper is to devise a fruitful decision-making model for a robot selection problem, which utilizes a multi-criteria decision-making method known as Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS). The TOPSIS method is based on the newly defined distance measure involving generalized fuzzy numbers with unequal heights (GFNUHs). Methodology/Approach: At first, we define a novel distance measure based on the "expected value"and "variance"of GFNUHs, where both the parameters are evaluated with the help of the α-cut method. We then also give the expression for the distance-based similarity measure and investigate some of their properties. Both the distance and the similarity measure(s) are then validated for their effectiveness through a hypothetical case study of pattern recognition. Moreover, we consider 10 different bunches of generalized fuzzy numbers (GFNs) and present a comparative study with the already established measures to establish the efficiency and superiority of our proposed measures. Finally, the distance measure is deployed in the TOPSIS method, which facilitates suitable robot selection by an automobile company. Findings/Results: A comparison of results for the proposed distance measure and the similarity measure with the existing ones is presented which proves that the proposed measure(s) are effective and usable. Novelty/Value: The evaluation of expected value and variance of GFNUHs with the help of α-cut technique is a completely original idea showcased in this paper and its improved version of TOPSIS for GFNUHs as discussed shall add a new direction in the realm of decision-making. © 2022 World Scientific Publishing Company.

AB  - The hammer test is generally used as one of the non-destructive methods for detecting defects such as voids and delamination in concrete structures like tunnels and bridges. It is necessary to eliminate human mistakes and improve quantitative analysis so that Impact Acoustics Method (IAM) was proposed and studied. IAM helps human decision of the defective concrete parts through comparing waveform and frequency distribution between healthy and defective parts which are taken from sensor or microphone. Hence, artificial intelligence (AI) is expected to replace or assist the human labor inspection by quantifying the defects. This research aims to inspect defects quickly and efficiently the only microphone through promoting a machine learning AI analysis system flow which mainly includes neural networks. Two experiments were held to achieve the purpose. © 2021 IABSE Congress, Ghent 2021: Structural Engineering for Future Societal Needs. All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose: This study aims to investigate about the use of artificial intelligence (AI) (man machine relationship) regarding organizational behavior. The aim of this research paper is to analyze whether the current AI is used also to replace man in “creative” activities. Design/methodology/approach: This study is based on a qualitative and explorative approach. It is made a review of the literature with “Scopus” and “Web of Science” databases. The research fields are AI, organizational behavior, man-machine relationship and creativity. Findings: Analyzing whether the intensive use of AI in organizational behavior can replace human work in creative activities. Research limitations/implications: The connection of AI with creative activities within the organization is only just beginning. For this reason, other sources, like Harvard Business Review, public reports and professional papers found on the internet have been considered. The most important limitation of this paper is that all the results presented here do not concern a single case study. Practical implications: In this paper, there are some examples that can show the use of AI in creative activities; however, this does not complete the situation facing companies in any sector because the AI technologies used within enterprises are constantly evolving. It is possible to continue to do research in this field. Originality/value: The paper is meaningful because highlights the development of AI toward creative activities typically of human resources. It is also interesting because it analyzes the exploratory use of AI in increasingly human work, generating positive and negative externalities. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - The prevalence of fake news could be observed in circumstances of emotion-causing events, like elections or pandemics. In fear of the potential impact, many fact-checking organisations were established. However, fact-checking requires a large amount of human labor, and hence there is a strong demand for complete automation of this process. Nevertheless, this milestone has not been achieved yet, even for English. The problem grows for the less popular languages that suffer from a scarcity of available resources. To address this problem for the Polish language domain, we propose a solution for automating one of the fact-checking stages - relevance assessment, which is crucial when searching for evidence. Leveraging recent advancements in natural language processing, we have acquired relevant data and developed classifiers of evidence relevance with respect to claims in Polish. Our approach can assess the evidence relevance with a performance at a level of a 0.778 F1-score. © 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - We study the long run implications of workplace automation induced by capital accumulation. We describe a minimal set of sufficient conditions for sustained growth, along with a declining labor share of income in the long run: (i) a basic asymmetry between physical and human capital; (ii) the technical possibility of automation in each sector; (ii) a self-replication condition on the production function for robot services; (iv) asymptotic homotheticity (more generally neutrality) of demand, and (v) a minimal degree of patience or intergenerational altruism among a fraction of households. However, the displacement of human labor is gradual, and absolute real wages could rise indefinitely. The results obtain in the absence of any technical progress; they extend to endogenous technical progress even if such progress is not biased ex ante in favor of automation. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - To identify recyclable garbage via the garbage classification is an effective countermeasure for protecting the environment. An automatic classification system supported by image recognition technologies is able to significantly reduce huge human labors of recycling tasks. However, performing the real-time and accurate garbage detection is not a trivial task. In this article, we present an edge-cloud framework equipped with deep learning model for recyclable garbage detection. Specifically, we propose to use the deep convolutional neural network for garbage images classification, and thus design the collaborative mechanism between edge devices and the cloud server. As a result, we design and develop a novel recyclable garbage detection system, where scanning garbage images and thus detecting recyclable ones can be completed in real-time. We validate the performances of the proposed recyclable garbage detection system on 1000 real-life household garbage images. Experimental results show the overall accuracy of our system reaches nearly 90%, and the time for detection is less than 500 ms. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - This paper addresses two methodological paths in Artificial Intelligence: the paths of Babbage and anti-Cartesianism. While those researchers who have followed the latter have attempted to reverse the Cartesian dictum according to which machines cannot think in principle, Babbage’s path, which has been partially neglected, implies that the replacement of humans—and not the creation of minds—should provide the foundation of AI. In view of the examined paths, the claim that we support here is this: in line with Babbage, AI researchers have recently concentrated upon the replacement of human labour, and thus upon the creation of Machine Learning systems. After presenting and analysing the paths, we characterise Machine Learning via its developments and an illustrative example. Then, we put forward an argument that shows that total replacement of human labour will not be feasible for practical and conceptual reasons despite the successful developments in recent AI systems. Our discussion finally leads to optimism and awareness: AI’s advances allow humans to dedicate themselves to higher level tasks, but these advances also require that we be vigilant about the responsibilities granted to ML-based systems. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Pilot implementations are field tests of properly engineered, yet unfinished, systems. In contrast to lab tests, the users in a pilot implementation use the system for performing real work. In contrast to full-scale implementations, the objective of a pilot implementation is to learn. The workshop on pilot implementation aims to (a) help mature this technique for evaluating human-work interaction designs during the process of their development and implementation, (b) collect case studies that analyze experiences with conducting and learning from pilot implementations, and (c) formulate a research agenda for future work on pilot implementations – addressing their strengths, limitations, conduct, impact, and so forth. The target audience for the workshop is researchers and practitioners working on topics related to work analysis, interaction design, system-organization fit, organizational implementation, benefits realization, and in-the-wild evaluation. © 2021, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.

AB  - The paper focuses on the design of competencies demanded by the ongoing digitalization of the Russian economy, with the purpose of providing g necessary human resources to back up an innovative breakthrough. The transition to a new model of Russian economic development is associated with the comprehension of fundamental global changes in the economy, business, and society. The speed of unfolding innovations does not allow to build a path of professional development for the entire career, unlike those previous paradigm based on long-term planning. The active introduction of artificial intelligence, robotics, algorithmization of work processes directly affects the labor market, accelerating the development of scientific and technological progress, eventually replacing human labor. The knowledge economy, formed using the products of the sixth technological order, poses a challenge to the whole education system. The challenge lies in the need to design competencies that allow a person to reflect on ongoing changes quickly. The author presented a list of basic competencies necessary for the continuous development of professional competencies in the digital economy throughout life. The integration of personal, social, and cognitive competencies formed based on the natural data, social education, and training, play an essential role in designing a competency model for the digital economy. The author refers to physical health, character, temperament, etc., as well as to personal competencies. Socio-behavioral competencies include communication, interpersonal skills, intercultural communication, etc. Cognitive competencies include self-development, achieving results, solving non-standard tasks, adaptability, entrepreneurship, stress tolerance, etc. The paper presents a diagram of the relationship of digital competencies with basic and professional ones in the sixth technological order. The author does not consider digital competencies as a separate block of competencies but suggests that digital competencies are manifested in the combination with basic and professional ones in a digital environment. The conducted research allows to identify certain practical aspects of designing competencies for the formation of human resources in the digital economy. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - The recent development of deep learning-based generative models has sharply intensified the interest in data synthesis and its applications. Data synthesis takes on an added importance especially for some pattern recognition tasks in which some classes of data are rare and difficult to collect. In an iris dataset, for instance, the minority class samples include images of eyes with glasses, oversized or undersized pupils, misaligned iris locations, and iris occluded or contaminated by eyelids, eyelashes, or lighting reflections. Such class-imbalanced datasets often result in biased classification performance. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are one of the most promising frameworks that learn to generate synthetic data through a two-player minimax game between a generator and a discriminator. In this paper, we utilized the state-of-the-art conditional Wasserstein generative adversarial network with gradient penalty (CWGAN-GP) for generating the minority class of iris images which saves huge amount of cost of human labors for rare data collection. With our model, the researcher can generate as many iris images of rare cases as they want and it helps to develop any deep learning algorithm whenever large size of dataset is needed.

AB  - Aquaculture is the fastest growing protein sector in the world. Automation in aquaculture is growing concomitantly with this field. Pond and tank systems routinely monitor dissolved oxygen (DO), operate alarm systems (often linked to a cell phone) to alert farmers of impending issues. Marine aquaculture is growing and larviculture is a critical life stage. During the larval stage, carnivorous fish often feed on zooplankton. When this occurs in natural ponds or lagoons, predation and mortality are often high. With larval fish in recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS), live feed such as rotifers and artemia are typically raised and then dosed into the RAS systems, allowing a much higher survival rate. However, this can be both time consuming and round-the-clock work as larval fish often need feeding every few hours. Automated systems to feed live feeds (e.g. artemia) can reduce human labor and possible human error, improve dosing and customize feeding for particular species or life stages. A discussion of recent and ongoing advances in automated live feed systems will be provided, sharing automated dosing, rates, feedback to optimize feedings and other critical aspects of these systems, including graphical user interfaces (GUI) and other communication structures. Ease of use is important for these systems to gain commercial success and contribute to this growing field. These systems can also enhance sustainability, reduce human error and improve safety outcomes. Further development in these fields is continuing, and lessons learned can also be useful when applied to adjacent fields including environmental, biomedical and agricultural engineering. © ASABE 2021 Annual International Meeting

AB  - Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) causes Chikungunya disease in human, transmitted by the Aedes species of mosquito. To this date, no vaccines are available to cure this disease as a result doctors rely on symptomatic treatment. This treatment is significantly based on recording the observation of signs and symptoms related to CHIKV in patients before prescribing medication. However, this disease can be misdiagnosed as its signs are similar to diseases like dengue or zika. This, in turn, gives rise to an uncertain diagnosis of Chikungunya. In addition, it is necessary to develop a system that will not only ensure the accurate assessment of Chikungunya but diagnose it within its early stages of infection. Since expert systems are adequate for handling uncertain data as well as generating more precise and accurate inferences, it is applied to this research. A Belief Rule Base Expert System (BRBES) is proposed in this research for performing the assessment of Chikungunya in its early stages of infection in patients. BRBES is reckoned to obliterate human labor and is computationally faster and less expensive in implementation and inferencing the assessment of CHIKV. This research is carried out using real-world data and inference of Chikungunya has been made by using Receiver Operating Characteristics Curves (ROC). In order to increase the accuracy of assessment, an optimal learning model of BRBES is developed with respect to various combinations of sets of training perimeters. In order to prove trained BRBES is an optimal learning model, it’s performance is differentiated with the initial BRBES. Further, this trained BRBES is also compared with a deep learning model such as Convolutional Neural networks (CNN) and machine learning models such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN). © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Fake content is ever increasing in the online environment, driven by various motivations such as gaining commercial and political advantages. The interactive and collaborative nature of social media further fuels the growth of fake content by exerting fast and widespread influence. Despite growing and interdisciplinary efforts in detecting fake content in social media, some common research challenges remain to be addressed such as humans' cognitive bias and scarcity of labeled data for training supervised machine learning models. This study aims to tackle both challenges by developing unsupervised deep learning models for the detection of fake content in social media. In view that traditional linguistic features fail to capture context information, our proposed method learns feature representations from the context in social media content. The empirical evaluation results with fake comments from YouTube demonstrate that our proposed methods not only outperform baseline models with traditional unsupervised machine learning techniques, but also achieve comparable performance to the state-of-the-art supervised models. The proposed analytical pipeline provides an end-to-end solution to detecting fake social media contents, which largely reduce the human labor required in collaborative data science teams (i.e., particularly the data labeling). The findings of this study can be used to facilitate collaboration in data science by reducing humans' cognitive bias and improve the collaboration efficiency. © 2021 IEEE Computer Society.

AB  - Robotic process automation (RPA) is the automation of business processes (BPs) using software robots. RPA robots automate repetitive, non-value-adding human work. The extent that a BP can be transformed into a software robot and its utility depends on several factors such as task type, complexity, repeated use, and regulatory compliance. The estimated RPA project failure rates are relatively high, and transforming the wrong BP is attributed as one of the critical reasons for this. Therefore, given a candidate set of BPs, it is imperative to identify only the suitable ones for RPA transformation. In this paper, a decision support tool (DST) is presented to select candidate BPs for RPA. First, 25 factors are identified from the literature that captures the characteristics of a BP. The list is then reduced to 16 factors based on a set of interviews with RPA subject matter experts (SMEs). Then an online survey with snowball sampling was conducted to measure the relevance of those factors in predicting the outcome of RPA transformation of a candidate BP. Finally, the two-class decision forest classification model was used to develop the DST. The utility of the proposed DST was validated by applying it to three RPA projects of a global IT consulting services company. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

AB  - Driven by digitally enabled machines, robotics and artificial intelligence, the speed and pace at which tasks can be automated are unprecedented. The changes in the nature of the work activity caused by an “automation revolution” is the motto for the current debate on automation and the future of human work. This debate has crystalized, so far, into forecasts estimating the extent to which occupations are “automatable”. But what are the real effects of automation in the content and pace of work? What is the place of the human activity within work environments increasingly automated? Through a research approach from the “point of view of activity”, two studies were designed to investigate these questions. Study 1 was conducted in two cork processing companies, whereas study 2 followed an exploratory strategy with Portuguese experts involved in the design of future automated driving situations. The findings suggest the activity constitutes the critical “link” between the theoretical definition of work automated processes and the real work. But such link remains “hidden” compared with the complexity of the automation apparatus. Diverging from techno-deterministic interpretations, the perspective of our research is to contribute to monitoring the ongoing transformations of work evoked by automation considering the operational leeway for workers develop their experience, preserve their health, and revalue their work practices. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - The 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, the epidemic of the Ebola virus, and currently the COVID-19 pandemic is an essential wake-up call for all countries to transform the approach to soil assessment and environmental management, and these diseases have proved how quickly a new virus can spread to every corner of the globe. With so many countries declaring the state of the emergency protocol due to the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, adopting and intensifying the provisions for the fourth industrial revolution technologies such as robotics and state-of-the-art mobile laboratories could be the only way to transform and expedite the approach to soil assessment, mapping, monitoring, and environmental management. This article proposes the fourth industrial revolution methodologies that can be adapted to assist the farmers and community in managing soils and the environment when the world nations are in a predicament of the pandemic such as COVID-19. The task would be to develop an outdoor automated or semi-autonomous machine vision system (drone or a robot) that can exceptionally substitute human labour on soil management tasks that are critical and cannot be performed by human labour as a result of COVID-19 national lockdown and any other related limitations of infield conventional assessment methods. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Deep learning models assist us in fruit classification, which allow us to use digital images from cameras to classify a fruit and find its class of ripeness automatically. Apple ripeness classification is a problem in computer vision and deep learning for pattern classification. In this paper, the ripeness of apples in digital images will be classified by using convolutional neural networks (CNN or ConvNets) in deep learning. The goal of this project is to verify the capability of deep learning models for fruit classification so as to lessen our human labor. Our experiments consist of four parts, namely, image preprocessing, apple detection, ripeness classification, and resultant evaluations. The contribution of this paper is that the classifiers are able to achieve the best result, i.e., the ripeness class of an apple from a given digital image is able to be precisely predicted. We have optimized the deep learning models and trained the classifiers so as to achieve the best outcome. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - In this paper, the Directed Technical Change model was extended to consider robotics and the monetary authority. Production, in two sectors, uses human labor and robotic labor, in addition to the intermediate goods where technological knowledge is incorporated. It resulted that the growth-inflation relationship is negative (positive) when there is substitutability (complementarity) between sectors. In addition, a relaxation of the CIA's restrictions on one sector promotes an improvement in technological knowledge of that sector and in the remuneration of the labor it uses. Both the direction of technological knowledge and the relative return on human labor depend positively on the relative importance of the human sector in the economy, the relative productivity of the human sector in R&D, and the increasing financial constraints for R&D producers in the robotic sector relative to the human sector. Finally, a numerical analysis gave an idea of the relative remuneration of human labor in the eurozone and allows the evaluation of theoretical results. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Andriod malware poses a serious threat to users privacy, money, equipment and file integrity. A series of data-driven malware detection methods were proposed. However, there exist two key challenges for these methods: (1) how to learn effective feature representation from raw data; (2) how to reduce the dependence on the prior knowledge or human labors in feature learning. Inspired by the success of deep learning methods in the feature representation learning community, we propose a malware detection framework which starts with learning rich-features by a novel unsupervised feature learning algorithm Merged Sparse Auto-Encoder (MSAE). In order to extract more compact and discriminative feature from the rich-features to further boost the malware detection capability, a hybrid deep network learning algorithm Stacked Hybrid Learning MSAE and SDAE (SHLMD) is established by further incorporating a classical deep learning method Stacked Denoising Auto-encoders (SDAE). After that, we feed the feature learned by MSAE and SHLMD respectively to classification algorithms to train a malware detection model. Evaluation results on two real-world datasets demonstrate that SHLMD achieves 94.46% and 90.57% accuracy respectively, which outperforms the classical unsupervised feature representation learning Sparse Auto-encoder (SAE).

AB  - Nowadays, on the one hand, due to the increase of equipment and smart environments, increasing attention to intelligence and the need to know more about the pose and shape of humans in these smart environments, and on the other hand the increase of being integrated the virtual world with the real world caused that the proper representation of humans in the virtual world has a great importance. Hence, human analysis of images has become very important. However, this work of human analysis not only goes beyond estimating a two-dimensional pose for one or multiple person, but it also goes beyond estimating a simple three-dimensional skeleton. The estimation of 3D human pose and shape of images has received special attention due to various applications in the real world. After studying and reviewing the papers in this field, it can be concluded that the existing approaches to obtain these estimates can be broadly grouped into two main approaches. An optimization-based approach and a deep learning-based approach are presented in which deep learning-based approaches are made in two methods: parametric and non-parametric. Optimization-based approaches provide the most reliable solution for obtaining these three-dimensional estimates. However, optimization-based approaches are slow to implement, sensitive to appropriate initialization, and often fail due to weak local minimums. So, the focus is on deep learning approaches that regress poses and shapes directly from images. But on the drawbacks, can be said of these deep learning-approaches require a lot of training data and time-consuming; in the other words, their execution time is also high and produce low-resolution 3D predictions. So after reviewing both available approaches, it is found that both methods are challenged to obtain acceptable results. In this paper we have mentioned the optimization-based approaches in general and our main focus is on the deep learning-based approaches. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Tremendous progress has been made in industry including artificial intelligence, robotics and 4th generation of industry. People in most countries work smarter, hard work is supplied by machines and automatics do constantly repeated operations. Modern technology has made work smarter, quicker and more precise than human works. But there are still many problems to tackle. Tension on effective work is much than higher. Companies prioritize well educated people. The value of the company is measured not only by the level of financial capital, either intellectual capital is also rated. There are economic reasons for prioritizing effectivity in industrial development, and intellectual capital increasing level of effectivity. On the other hand, there are some arguments for prioritizing social and ethical responsibility. Economic growth could not be the only reason for development in business. In addition, involvement in corruption scandals and environmental accidents can severely damage the reputation of a company. Innovation in management is needed. Some results of investigations in that area suggested that ethical leadership could gain negative consequences of human behavior. Finally, it has been found that the development in ethical leadership could bring the benefits for employee and employers and can increase level of productivity and thus profits of companies. The main aim of the article is to describe an investigation of ethical leadership influence on companies. © 2021 The Authors. Journal Compilation.

AB  - We present here the development and evaluation of a deep learning (artificial intelligence)-based computer vision machine to automate segmentation of multiclass progressive matrix damage across micro and mesoscales in aerospace-grade advanced composite laminates visualized in 4D via nondestructive in situ mechanical testing coupled with synchrotron radiation computed tomography (SRCT). Leveraging tens of thousands of manually-/human-annotated SRCT tomograms (i.e., 2D virtual cross-sectional slices) encompassing two different aerospace-grade advanced composite laminate systems (standard-thickness-ply and thin-ply) that were SRCT-scanned while under progressive tensile loading, we teach a fully convolutional neural network machine to segment complex polymer matrix damage mechanisms according to their host ply, replacing ~10 hours of trained human labor per scan segmentation (~2000 tomograms per scan) with negligible time to configure the trained machine data-processing pipeline. Evaluating qualitatively and quantitatively the segmented tomograms independently in 2D, as well as collectively in 3D scans, we demonstrate good agreement between the state-of-the-art human-based region growing (semi-manual) method and machine-based segmentation results, summarized by test set macro-averages of the following common classification/segmentation performance metrics: 79% for F1 score (harmonic mean of precision and recall) and 67% for intersection over union (IoU) score. Moreover, 2D inspection of segmented damage within tomograms reveals that F1 and IoU scores actually underrate machine performance due to a nontrivial degree of human (used as ground truth) segmentation error, as the machine is found to regularly exceed the human (resulting in F1 and IoU score penalties) by discovering new damage instances, augmenting existing diffuse segmentations, and extending segmentations to image artifact-prone specimen edges. Consequently, we discover that deep learning-based segmentation successfully and efficiently characterizes sparse (<<1% of scan volume), extremely complex 3D damage states within SRCT datasets, resolving an intractable computer vision challenge (as viewed through the lens of traditionally programmed automation) and establishing these high-throughput tools as promising candidates to accelerate understanding of basic structure-property relationships in traditional and next-generation advanced composite materials. © 2021, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

AB  - Manufacturing processes in the shoe industry are still characterized to a large extent by human labour, especially in small and medium craft enterprises. Even when machinery is adopted to support manufacturing operations, in most cases an operator has to supervise or carry out the task. On the other hand, craft footwear industries are called to respond to continuous challenges to face the globalization effects, so that a rapid adaptability to customer needs is required. The industry 4.0 paradigms, which are taking place in the industrial environments, represent an excellent opportunity to improve the efficiency and quality of production, and a way to face international competitors. This paper analyses and proposes a robotic cell to automatize the process of glue deposition on shoe upper, which exploits a new means of depositing the glue compared to State-of-Art applications. While the latter mainly adopt glue gun spraying systems or pneumatic syringes, the proposed robotic cell is based on an extrusion system for the deposition of molten material originally in the form of a filament, similar to all extent to those adopted for Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM). Two cell solutions are designed and tested. In the former the extruder is the robot end effector and the shoe upper is grounded to the cell frame. In the second, being the reciprocal, the shoe last is clamped to the robot wrist and the extruder is fixed to the cell frame. The peculiarities of the two solutions are pointed out and compared in terms of cell layout, hardware, programming software and possibility to develop collaborative applications. A self developed slicing software allows designing the trajectories for glue deposition based on the CAD model of the shoe upper, also allowing driving the inclination of the extruder nozzle with respect to the vectors normal to the upper surface. Both the proposed cell layouts permit to achieve good quality and production times. The solution with the mobile extruder is able to deposit glue at highest end-effector speed (up to 200 mm/s). On the other hand, the solution with the mobile shoe upper and fixed extruder seems to be more appropriate to enhance collaborative applications. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - As a result of the difficulties brought by COVID-19 and its associated lockdowns, many individuals and companies have turned to robots in order to overcome the challenges of the pandemic. Compared with traditional human labor, robotic and autonomous systems have advantages such as an intrinsic immunity to the virus and an inability for human-robot-human spread of any disease-causing pathogens, though there are still many technical hurdles for the robotics industry to overcome. This survey comprehensively reviews over 200 reports covering robotic systems which have emerged or have been repurposed during the past several months, to provide insights to both academia and industry. In each chapter, we cover both the advantages and the challenges for each robot, finding that robotics systems are overall apt solutions for dealing with many of the problems brought on by COVID-19, including: diagnosis, screening, disinfection, surgery, telehealth, care, logistics, manufacturing and broader interpersonal problems unique to the lockdowns of the pandemic. By discussing the potential new robot capabilities and fields they applied to, we expect the robotics industry to take a leap forward due to this unexpected pandemic. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning have enormous potential to transform businesses and disrupt entire industry sectors. However, companies wishing to integrate algorithmic decisions into their organization face multiple challenges: They have to identify use-cases in which artificial intelligence can create value, as well as decisions that can be supported or executed automatically. Furthermore, the organization will need to be transformed to be able to integrate AI-based systems into their human work-force. In addition, the more technical aspects of the underlying machine learning model have to be discussed in terms of how they impact the various units of a business: Where do the relevant data come from, which constraints have to be considered, how is the quality of the data and the prediction evaluated? The Enterprise AI canvas is designed to bring data scientist and business expert together to discuss and define all relevant aspects which need to be clarified in order to integrate AI-based systems into a digital enterprise. It consists of two parts, where part one focuses on the business view and organizational aspects, whereas part two focuses on the underlying machine learning model and the data it uses. © 2020 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Advances in robotics, automation, and artificial intelligence increasingly enable firms to replace human labor with technology, thereby fundamentally transforming how goods and services are produced. From both managerial and societal points of view, it is therefore important to understand demand-side incentives for firms to employ human labor. We begin to address this question by examining for which products and services consumers are more likely to favor human (vs. robotic) labor. In six studies, we demonstrate that consumers prefer human (vs. robotic) labor more for products with higher (vs. lower) symbolic value (e.g., when expressing something about one's beliefs and personality is of greater importance). We theorize that this is because consumers have stronger uniqueness motives in more (vs. less) symbolic consumption contexts (and associate human labor more strongly with product uniqueness). In line with this account, we demonstrate that individual differences in need for uniqueness moderate the interaction between production mode and symbolic motives and that a measure of uniqueness motives mediates the effect of consumption context on preferences for human (vs. robotic) production. © 2020 The Authors.

AB  - Recognition of key morphological features in histological slides is crucial for pathological diagnosis and monitoring therapeutic progress. However, the typical routine microscopic workflow is conducted by hand which is time-consuming and has unavoidable intra- and inter-observer variability like all human work. Therefore, we propose a bifocal classification and fusion network for the automated recognition and cross-modality analysis of diagnostic features in whole-slide multimodal images (WSIs). In brief, paired image tiles cropped from digitized tissue sections were fed into a modified dual-path CNN which accepts asymmetric inputs for classification, and then the inference results were converted to feature distribution heatmaps, which permit qualitative as well as quantitative morphological analyses of entire histological sections, even in combination with adjacent sections that have been stained differently. The multimodal heatmaps were aligned using image registration and fused for cross-modality analysis. Our experiments showed that the network achieved high recognition performance (AUCs of 0.985 and 0.988, and accuracies of 94.7% and 96.1% on two WSI modalities, respectively, against expert markings) and outperformed state-of-the-art methods without training on a large cohort or utilizing domain transfer. In addition, the new method involves a self-contained inference and fusion process and thus harbors significant potential for speeding up microscopic analysis workflows. © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - Insights from public companies' financial filings are necessary for securities analysts and investors to make the right investment decisions. Synthesizing salient facts from such filings is a complex language task, especially now as the data volume is growing at an overwhelming pace. To ease human labor in this process, our work proposed a financial filing analysis pipeline which automatically scrapes financial filings, generates the embeddings of the contextual data and performs sentiment analysis in order to predict future performance of the underlying companies. The pipeline is built on top of Big Data processing platform HPCC Systems to enable the capability of processing large amounts of financial filings in a scalable and timely manner. By applying word embedding and machine learning models to a large amount of SEC financial filings, our pipeline is able to process 20 GB of XBRL files - 5,000 filing documents for more than 3,500 companies - into 50,000 sentence embeddings within 5 minutes and transform the same data to TF-IDF embedding in about 8 minutes. To test sentiment analysis, we randomly sampled and manually labeled 5,000 SEC filings. As a result, the sentiment analysis suggested that the usefulness of stock price as a metric is specific to each industry and overall market, but is usable as long as the scope of inquiry is sufficiently narrow. Additionally, while our model is trained only on 5,000 manually labeled filings with unigrams and a final loss of 0.09, the results of the sentiment analysis exhibited discriminatory power exceeding naïve label selection through random or biased choice, suggesting that there is efficacy in using Natural Language Processing to analyze SEC filings. © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - The Future of Work (FoW) is witnessing an evolution where AI systems are used to the benefit of humans. Work here refers to all forms of paid and unpaid labor in both physical and virtual workplaces and that is enabled by AI systems. This covers crowdsourcing platforms such as Amazon Mechanical Turk, online labor marketplaces such as TaskRabbit and Qapa, but also regular jobs in physical workplaces. Bringing humans back to the frontier of FoW will increase their trust in AI systems and shift their perception to use them as a source of self-improvement, en sure better work performance, and positively shape social and economic outcomes of a society and a nation. To enable that, physical and virtual work places will need to capture human traits, behavior, evolving needs, and provide jobs to all. Attitudes, values, opinions regarding the processes and policies will need to be assessed and considered in the design of FoW ecosystems.

AB  - Pipelines deteriorate gradually over a period of time due to various factors. The limitation in these pipeline systems is that they are affected by various factors such as environmental conditions, corrosion, cracks etc. Maintenance and repair of these systems are labor-intensive and expensive. This can be solved by designing a pipeline inspection robot that would reduce human labor. Such robots will also be helpful in pipeline inspection in hazardous and in accessible environments. This paper aims to review the different types of pipeline robots based on various characteristics such as accuracy in inspection, size and adaptability to shape, flexibility, vertical mobility, scalability, cost, speed, design complexity, impact on the pipe and motion efficiency. Based on the literature survey, a design is proposed. © 2020 Author(s).

AB  - To identify recyclable garbage via the garbage classification is an effective countermeasure for protecting the environment. An automatic classification system supported by image recognition technologies is able to significantly reduce huge human labors of recycling tasks. However, performing the real-time and accurate garbage detection is not a trivial task. In this paper, we present an Edge-Cloud framework equipped with deep learning model for recyclable garbage detection. Specifically, we propose to use the deep convolutional neural network for garbage images classification, and thus design the collaborative mechanism between edge devices and the cloud server. As a result, we design and develop a novel recyclable garbage detection system, where scanning garbage images and thus detecting recyclable ones can be completed in real-time. We validate the performances of the proposed recyclable garbage detection system on 1000 real-life household garbage images. Experimental results show the recyclable garbage detection rate is over 85%, and the time for detection is less than 500 milliseconds. © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - Over the last few years, the research into agriculture has gained momentum, showing signs of rapid growth. The latest to appear on the scene is bringing convenience in how agriculture can be done by employing various computational technologies. There are lots of factors that affect agricultural production, with seed quality topping the list. Seed classification can provide additional knowledge about quality production, seed quality control and impurity identification. The process of categorising seeds has been traditionally done based on characteristics like colour, shape and texture. Generally, this is performed by specialists by visually inspecting each sample, which is a very tedious and time-consuming task. This procedure can be easily automated, providing a significantly more efficient method for seed sorting than having them be inspected using human labour. In related areas, computer vision technology based on machine learning (ML), symmetry and, more particularly, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been generously applied, often resulting in increased work efficiency. Considering the success of the computational intelligence methods in other image classification problems, this research proposes a classification system for seeds by employing CNN and transfer learning. The proposed system contains a model that classifies 14 commonly known seeds with the implication of advanced deep learning techniques. The techniques applied in this research include decayed learning rate, model checkpointing and hybrid weight adjustment. This research applies symmetry when sampling the images of the seeds during data formation. The application of symmetry generates homogeneity with regards to resizing and labelling the images to extract their features. This resulted in 99% classification accuracy during the training set. The proposed model produced results with an accuracy of 99% for the test set, which contained 234 images. These results were much higher than the results reported in related research. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - With the increasing network topology complexity and continuous evolution of the new wireless technology, it is challenging to address the network service outage with traditional methods. In the long-term evolution (LTE) networks, a large number of base stations called eNodeBs are deployed to cover the entire service areas spanning various kinds of geographical regions. Each eNodeB generates a large number of key performance indicators (KPIs). Hundreds of thousands of eNodeBs are typically deployed to cover a nation-wide service area. Operators need to handle hundreds of millions of KPIs to cover the areas. It is impractical to handle manually such a huge amount of KPI data, and automation of data processing is therefore desired. To improve network operation efficiency, a suitable machine learning technique is used to learn and classify individual eNodeBs into different states based on multiple performance metrics during a specific time window. However, an issue with supervised learning requires a large amount of labeled dataset, which takes costly human-labor and time to annotate data. To mitigate the cost and time issues, we propose a method based on few-shot learning that uses Prototypical Networks algorithm to complement the eNodeB states analysis. Using a dataset from a live LTE network that consists of thousand of eNodeB, our experiment results show that the proposed technique provides high performance while using a low number of labeled data. © 2004-2012 IEEE.

AB  - This decade has witnessed a paradigm shift in human-labor based rescue-surveillance operations. Research propositions have explored the possibility of replacing manual intervention for the management of catastrophic situations by a team of robots. However, to implement the concept into practice, the robotics community has faced several challenges. The multi-robotic system has to be duly coordinated efficaciously by controllers to automate the operations thereby saving the lives of the rescuers. Subsequently, the controller/s should be able to ensemble the robots forming a particular shape depending on the varying environmental conditions. Moreover, it would allow the group to switch its current formation so that the system could maneuver towards the target while avoiding static/dynamic obstacles. To address these challenges, we have proposed a hierarchical control strategy so that the robots could maintain a strong inter-agent cohesiveness and simultaneously could switch their formation in the face of the changing situations and could pursue the goal of arriving towards the target. The formation control law has been designed based on the echolocation principle of the bio-inspired bat algorithm. The algorithm, corroborated by the simulation results and the real-time experiments is exceptionally useful for forming the desired pattern, changing the formation adaptively whenever obstructions show up in their trajectories. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

AB  - We consider the challenging task of evaluating the commercial viability of hydrocarbon prospects based on limited information, and in limited time. We investigate purely data-driven approaches to predicting key reservoir parameters and obtain a negative result: the information that is typically available for prospect evaluation and is suitable for data-based methods, cannot be used for the required predictions. We can show however that the same information is sufficient to produce a limited list of potentially similar well-explored reservoirs (known as analogues) that can support the prospect evaluation work of human geoscientists. We base the proposal of analogues on similarity measures on the data available about prospects. Technically, the challenge is to define suitable similarity measures on categorical data like depositional environment or rock types. Existing data-based similarity measures for categorical data do not perform well, since they do not take geological domain knowledge into account. We propose two novel similarity measures that use domain knowledge in the form of hierarchies on categorical values. Comparative evaluation shows that the semantic-based similarity measures outperform the existing data-driven approaches and are effective in comparison to the human analogue selection. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - Sustainability is typically viewed as consisting of three forces, economic, social, and ecological, in tension with one another. In this paper, we address the dangers posed to societal sustainability. The concern being addressed is the very survival of societies where the rights of individuals, personal and collective freedoms, an independent judiciary and media, and democracy, despite its messiness, are highly valued. We argue that, as a result of various technological innovations, a range of dysfunctional impacts are threatening social and political stability. For instance, robotics and automation are replacing human labor and decision-making in a range of industries; search engines, monetized through advertising, have access to, and track, our interests and preferences; social media, in connecting us to one another often know more about us than we ourselves do, enabling them to profit in ways which may not coincide with our well-being; online retailers have not only acquired the ability to track and predict our buying choices, but also they can squeeze vendors based on their outsize bargaining power; and, in general, virtual technologies have changed both the way we think and our sense of self. With the rising deployment of the Internet of Things, and developments in machine learning and artificial intelligence, the threats to individual freedoms and rights, societal cohesion and harmony, employment and economic well-being, and trust in democracy are being ratcheted up. This paper lauds the benefits and addresses the harm wrought by the high tech giants in Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs). The search for rapidly growing revenues (and shareholder returns and stock prices) drives firms to accelerate product innovation without fully investigating the entire gamut of their impacts. As greater wealth accrues to the leaders of tech firms, inequalities within firms and societies are widening, creating social tensions and political ferment. We explore the ethical nature of the challenge employing a simple utilitarian calculus, complemented by approaches rooted in rights, justice, and the common good. Various options to address the challenges posed by ICTs are considered and evaluated. We argue that regulation may do little more than slow down the damage to society, particularly since societal values and political preferences vary internationally. Firms need to establish ethical standards, imbuing the upholders of these standards with sufficient authority, while creating a culture of morality. User involvement and activism, and shareholders’ concerns for the sustainability of societies on whose continued prosperity they depend, are imperative to humanity’s ability to decide the future direction of technology. © 2020, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Machine learning methods are very widely used in helping human work. Not all data is as we expected. Some data have missing values. Data that has a missing value must be handled first at the pre-processing stage, one of which is by the imputation of the missing value. This study is comparing the imputation method of missing value uses mode and One-Dimensional Naïve Bayes Classifier (1DNBC) to determine the performance analysis by using Support Vector Machine (SVM) for the prediction of car insurance participation. A better method is seen from the accuracy. Based on the simulation is obtained the same results for imputation using mode and One-Dimensional Naïve Bayes are 1.00, which when examined further turns out to be the imputation of each missing value with the mode and prediction of imputation with One-Dimensional Naïve Bayes are the same. © 2020 American Institute of Physics Inc..

AB  - Chili is among top grown crops in Malaysia. Nevertheless, chili plant growth monitoring in Malaysia is still performed manually by human labor, which consumed lots of time, energy and the plant growth can only be monitored at site. Hence, this paper discussed the potential of deep learning algorithm in classifying chili plant growth images from a small dataset. The experiment is performed on 256 chili plant images that under various conditions, where the images were captured using a 12-megapixel and f/1.8 aperture camera. Experimented using ResNet-101 and ResNet-50 of Mask R-CNN models with 75% of the dataset for training and 25% for testing, the results showed that both models were able to detect the correct age of chili plants with accuracy of 96% for Mask R-CNN ResNe-50 which is lower than Mask R-CNN ResNe-101 by 1%. © 2020 IEEE

AB  - Improvement of productivity and efficiency in the agriculture sector points towards the necessity of developing autonomous vehicles. Here, the detection and classification of objects plays a major role, which can be achieved by using camera sensors and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). In order to train CNNs to perform correctly, good datasets are required. However, especially for the case of agriculture, datasets that contain relevant objects and are labeled (i.e. annotated with ground truth information) are not only scarce but also difficult to generate as this entails a high cost in resources and human labor. Therefore, we propose a different approach: using 3D simulation technology to generate relevant simulated sensor data which are implicitly labeled and a cost efficient solution to train neural networks. In this contribution, we assess the viability of training a CNN with simulated sensor data by comparing the achieved performance to a network trained with real sensor data. In addition, we evaluate the benefits of combining simulated data with real data for training CNNs, including complementary as well as Transfer Learning approaches. Finally, we show that using simulated sensor data for training CNNs is viable yet less accurate than using comparable real datasets and propose ways to improve simulations in this regard. To this end, we analyze various simulation factors in terms of their impact on the CNN performance and introduce further benefits of using simulated scenarios in general. © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - New technologies offer employers the ability to replace tasks done by human labour with those done by machines. There are challenges for both employers and employees, as employers look for strategies for the implementation of automation technologies and employees may have concerns about their employment being threatened by automation technologies. In this research, we analyse data of over 500 Bulgarians to learn about how they perceive the automation of their jobs. The analysis finds that there are segments of the population defined by demographics and attitudes that are more fearful of the automation of their jobs than others. Additionally, we see that attitudes towards the dehumanizing effects of automation, peer-pressure, job automatability, and a person's self-perception of professionalism are the main drivers of the fear of automation. Finally, the paper evaluates respondents' attitudes towards various individual, corporate and social solutions to automation fears. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Services are changing at an impressive pace boosted by the technological advances felt in Robotics, Big Data, and Artificial Intelligence (AI) that have uncovered new research opportunities. Our objective is to contribute to the literature by exploring the pros and cons of the use of service robots in the hospitality industry and to practice, by presenting the architectural and technological characteristics of a fully automated plant based on a relevant case. To achieve such goal, this article uses a systematic literature review to assess the state-of-the-art, characterize the unit of analysis, and find new avenues for further research. The results indicate that, in high customer contact settings, service robots tend to outperform humans when performing standardized tasks, because of their mechanical and analytical nature. Evidence also shows that, in some cases, service robots have not yet achieved the desired technological maturity to proficiently replace humans. In other words, the technology is not quite there yet, but this does not contradict the fact that new robot technologies, enabled by AI, will be able to replace the employees’ empathetic intelligence. In practical terms, organizations are facing challenges where they have to decide whether service robots are capable of completely replacing human labor or if they should rather invest in balanced options, such as human-robot systems, that seem to be a much more rational choice today. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - With the declining birthrate and the aging population, the shortage of labor has become more obvious. Therefore, the teleoperation of the robot as the substitute of human labour have become popular. In this study, an application of real-time gesture-based human-robot interaction is proposed using a Kinect sensor for elderly care. By employing gesture-based teleoperation of robots, demands, and conditions of the elderly such as sudden falling and the abnormality can be quickly recognized. The robot used in this study, iRobot Create, is a popular mobile robot for indoor usage which will recognize the following gestures: right-hand raising, left-hand raising, right-hand waving, and left hand waving, in corresponding to the control the robot's moving forward, backward, right turn, and left turn, respectively. Experimental results shown that the four types of gestures can be recognized by the iRobot Create with human gestures captured by the Kinect sensor. The corresponding actions in real-time were realized through the designed gesture-based remote human-robot interaction system. The experimental results are also can be seen from the Youtube channel. © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - RATIONALE: Computer-assisted detection (CAD) systems based on artificial intelligence (AI) using convolutional neural network (CNN) have been successfully used for the diagnosis of unruptured cerebral aneurysms in experimental situations. However, it is yet unclear whether CAD systems can detect cerebral aneurysms effectively in real-life clinical situations. This paper describes the diagnostic efficacy of CAD systems for cerebral aneurysms and the types of cerebral aneurysms that they can detect. PATIENT CONCERNS: From March 7, 2017 to August 26, 2018 we performed brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans for 1623 subjects, to rule out intracranial diseases. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records including the history and images for each patient. DIAGNOSES, INTERVENTIONS AND OUTCOMES: Among them, we encountered 5 cases in whom the cerebral aneurysms had been overlooked in the first and second round of imaging, and were detected for the first time by CAD. All missed aneurysms were less than 2 mm in diameter. Of the 5 aneurysms, 2 were internal carotid artery (ICA) paraclinoid aneurysms, 2 were Internal carotid-posterior communicating artery (IC-PC) aneurysms and 1 was a distal middle cerebral artery (MCA) aneurysm. LESSONS: Our CAD system can detect very small aneurysms masked by the surrounding arteries and difficult for radiologists to detect. In the future, CAD systems might pave the way to substitute the workload of diagnostic radiologists and reduce the cost of human labor.

AB  - Human labor energy still provides a large and dominant contribution in rice cultivation in Indonesia. This study is specified to determine human energy needed for primary tillage operation in paddy cultivation practices in Padang Pariaman, West Sumatera Indonesia. The objectives of this research are to analyze human energy expenditure for primary tillage operation and to compare between real-time measurement and conversion factor of energy. The data were collected with three different plot areas with average size 30 m × 25 m. The analysis of human energy consumption conducted by two methods (predicted energy using conversion factor value of energy and real-time energy using Garmin Forerunner 35). The result shows that the real-time measurements of labor energy expenditure for primary tillage operation were 17.7291, 19.2857, and 12.2483 MJ/ha, respectively. However, the labor energy defined by the conversion factor were 13.3568, 14.0141 and 12.7498 MJ/ha, respectively. Thus, tillage operation with average heart beat rate was 127 bpm, it could be categorized as heavy work. This information is needed as a basis to improve and recommend designing of agricultural equipment and machinery, and also tools to reduce the use of labor energy. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Road network and building footprint extraction is essential for many applications such as updating maps, traffic regulations, city planning, ride-hailing, disaster response etc. Mapping road networks is currently both expensive and labor-intensive. Recently, improvements in image segmentation through the application of deep neural networks has shown promising results in extracting road segments from large scale, high resolution satellite imagery. However, significant challenges remain due to lack of enough labeled training data needed to build models for industry grade applications. In this paper, we propose a two-stage transfer learning technique to improve robustness of semantic segmentation for satellite images that leverages noisy pseudo ground truth masks obtained automatically (without human labor) from crowd-sourced OpenStreetMap (OSM) data. We further propose Pyramid Pooling-LinkNet (PP-LinkNet), an improved deep neural network for segmentation that uses focal loss, poly learning rate, and context module. We demonstrate the strengths of our approach through evaluations done on three popular datasets over two tasks, namely, road extraction and building foot-print detection. Specifically, we obtain 78.19% meanIoU on SpaceNet building footprint dataset, 67.03% and 77.11% on the road topology metric on SpaceNet and DeepGlobe road extraction dataset, respectively. © 2020 ACM.

AB  - Agriculture is the backbone in the Indian economy. To farmers development in new technologies will help them to have better farming activities. Without having the information about the soil nature it will be difficult for the farmers to have the cultivation process in an effective manner.

AB  - The effects of the spread of Artificial Intelligence (AI) on salaries depend both on the way in which human labour has to be integrated in the production of products and on the elasticity of substitution. A rise in robotic labour may either have positive or negative effects on wages by means of a traditional mechanism involving labour, robots and common resources. Alternatively, the aggregate output relationship can be calculated directly by using Houthakker's 1950s method without measuring capital or other fixed variables. The method of Houthakker is based on the probability distribution of the variable factor productivity. The various distributions on the US productivity are indicated for cross-sectional results. The growth of AI technologies will cause salaries to decrease, other things equal to, if the Elasticity of Replacement between Human and ROBOTIC labour is higher than about 1.9. For the processing industry, even less human-robot replacement elasticity is likely to result in lower industrial workers ' salaries as robots proliferate. © 2020 Alpha Publishers.

AB  - Recent developments within theinternet and the growth of sensor platforms have enabled the implementation and exchange of multi-disciplinary and cross-dominant data in different applications, used to connect physical devices (things) to the real world. This development also has a number of advantages for the agriculture sector: optimal resource management and the improvement of human labour (i.e. crop growth monitoring and selection, support for decision-making in irrigation, fertilizers, pesticides, agro-chemistry, etc.). In this work, the rodents and especially field rats are our primary emphasis. Around 80 percent of human food is obtained from grains and 50 percent of overall food loss is caused by pests. Till now only traditional optimization actions have been commonly used for pest management, such as traps, electrical fences, rodenticides, etc. Integrating pesticide management (IPM) is an effective and dedicated approach to the control of pesticides. It uses the latest knowledge about the pest's life cycle and its relationship with the environment. This paper demonstrates a smart pest control solution (SPEC) in order to track the rat's behaviour and activities in the field to the pest control experts /farmers so that they can apply traditional control methods more efficiently. In this paper, one new approach for animal detection is developed using ToxTrac and NS2 simulator. Simulation results show that agriculture monitoring using toxtrac and NS2 is an efficient system.. © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - Human labor still play an important role in cane sugar crystallization process. Automation control is essential to reduce human labor. An accurate image classification system is the basis for automation control of the cane sugar crystallization process. This paper builds a deep learning framework based on deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) to classify cane sugar crystallization image of cane sugar crystallization process for sugar factory. Different networks were trained on a large image data set obtained from a sugar batch crystallizer. Based on the data set, the established model was used to classify cane sugar crystallization image. The classification accuracy of the proposed model reached 0.901. The confusion matrix of the InceptionResNetV2 model indicates classification accuracy of between 0.83 and 0.99 are achieved in classifying cane sugar crystal images from a cane sugar factory into 5 categories. This provides a promising means for the future development of monitoring systems using image. The proposed DCNNs model was compared against other models, such as, Inception-V3, ResNet50, and a simple DCNNs. The experimental results showed that the deep learning framework outweighs other models and can serve as a benchmark of monitoring cane sugar crystallization using DCNNs in sugar industry. © 2020

AB  - Infectious diseases are caused by pathogenic microorganisms, whose transmission can lead to global pandemics like COVID-19. Contact with contaminated surfaces or objects is one of the major channels of spreading infectious diseases among the community. Therefore, the typical contaminable surfaces, such as walls and handrails, should often be cleaned using disinfectants. Nevertheless, safety and efficiency are the major concerns of the utilization of human labor in this process. Thereby, attention has drifted toward developing robotic solutions for the disinfection of contaminable surfaces. A robot intended for disinfecting walls should be capable of following the wall concerned, while maintaining a given distance, to be effective. The ability to operate in an unknown environment while coping with uncertainties is crucial for a wall disinfection robot intended for deployment in public spaces. Therefore, this paper contributes to the state-of-the-art by proposing a novel method of establishing the wall-following behavior for a wall disinfection robot using fuzzy logic. A non-singleton Type 1 Fuzzy Logic System (T1-FLS) and a non-singleton Interval Type 2 Fuzzy Logic System (IT2-FLS) are developed in this regard. The wall-following behavior of the two fuzzy systems was evaluated through simulations by considering heterogeneous wall arrangements. The simulation results validate the real-world applicability of the proposed FLSs for establishing the wall-following behavior for a wall disinfection robot. Furthermore, the statistical outcomes show that the IT2-FLS has significantly superior performance than the T1-FLS in this application. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Soybean plant density is an important factor of successful agricultural production. Due to the high number of plants per unit area, early plant overlapping and eventual plant loss, the estimation of soybean plant density in the later stages of development should enable the determination of the final plant number and reflect the state of the harvest. In order to assess soybean plant density in a digital, nondestructive, and less intense way, analysis was performed on RGB images (containing three channels: RED, GREEN, and BLUE) taken with a UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) on 66 experimental plots in 2018, and 200 experimental plots in 2019. Mean values of the R, G, and B channels were extracted for each plot, then vegetation indices (VIs) were calculated and used as predictors for the machine learning model (MLM). The model was calibrated in 2018 and validated in 2019. For validation purposes, the predicted values for the 200 experimental plots were compared with the real number of plants per unit area (m2). Model validation resulted in the correlation coefficient-R = 0.87, mean absolute error (MAE) = 6.24, and root mean square error (RMSE) = 7.47. The results of the research indicate the possibility of using the MLM, based on simple values of VIs, for the prediction of plant density in agriculture without using human labor. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Under the pressure of climate change, energy-efficient manufacturing has attracted much attention. Robotic assembly lines are widely-used in automotive and electronic manufacturing. It is necessary to consider the energy saving and economic criteria simultaneously when robots are utilized to operate assembly tasks replacing human labor. This paper addresses an energy-efficient robotic assembly line balancing (EERALB) problem with the criteria to minimize both the cycle time and total energy consumption. We present a multi-objective mathematical model and propose a bound-guided hybrid estimation of distribution algorithm to solve the problem. When designing the optimization algorithm, we adopt estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) to tackle the task assignment, and design a non-dominated robot allocation (NGRA) heuristic which is embedded into the EDA to allocate suitable robot to each workstation. Moreover, we propose a bound-guided sampling (BGS) method, which is able to reduce the search space of EDA and focus the search on the promising area. The computational complexity of the proposed algorithm is analyzed and the effectiveness of the proposed NGRA and BGS is tested. In addition, we compare the performances of the proposed mathematical model and the proposed algorithm with those of the existing model and algorithms on a set of widely-used benchmark instances. Comparative results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and algorithm. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The recent literature on the economic effects of machine learning, robotization and artificial intelligence suggests that there may be an upcoming wave of substitution of human labor by machines. We argue that these new technologies may lead to so-called perpetual growth, i.e. growth of per capita income with a non-progressing state of technology. We specify an exact parameter threshold beyond which perpetual growth emerges, and argue that ongoing technological change may bring the threshold in reach. We also show that in a state of perpetual growth, factor-eliminating technological progress reduces the role of labor in the production process and that this leads to a rising wage rate but ever-declining share of wage income. We present simulation experiments on several policy options to combat this inequality, including a universal basic income as well as an option in which workers become owners of ‘robots’. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Agricultural production in sub-Saharan Africa remains dependent on high inputs of human labor, a situation associated with direct exposure to daylight heat during critical periods of the agricultural calendar. We ask the question: how is the Wet-Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT) going to be distributed in the future, and how will this affect the ability of smallholder farmers to perform agricultural activities? Data from general circulation models are used to estimate the distribution of WBGT in 2000, 2050 and 2100, and for high activity periods in the agricultural calendar. The distribution of WBGT is divided into recommended maximum WBGT exposure levels (°C) at different work intensities, and rest/work ratios for an average acclimatized worker wearing light clothing (ISO, 18). High WBGTs are observed during the two periods of the East African. In February to March, eastern and coastal regions of Kenya and Tanzania witness high WBGT values-some necessitating up to 75% rest/hour work intensities in 2050 and 2100. In August to September, eastern and northern Kenya and north and central Uganda are vulnerable to high WBGT values. Designing policies to address this key challenge is a critical element in adaptation methods to address the impact of climate change. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Objective: Accurate coding is critical for medical billing and electronic medical record (EMR)-based research. Recent research has been focused on developing supervised methods to automatically assign International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes from clinical notes. However, supervised approaches rely on ICD code data stored in the hospital EMR system and is subject to bias rising from the practice and coding behavior. Consequently, portability of trained supervised algorithms to external EMR systems may suffer. Method: We developed an unsupervised knowledge integration (UNITE) algorithm to automatically assign ICD codes for a specific disease by analyzing clinical narrative notes via semantic relevance assessment. The algorithm was validated using coded ICD data for 6 diseases from Partners HealthCare (PHS) Biobank and Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-III). We compared the performance of UNITE against penalized logistic regression (LR), topic modeling, and neural network models within each EMR system. We additionally evaluated the portability of UNITE by training at PHS Biobank and validating at MIMIC-III, and vice versa. Results: UNITE achieved an averaged AUC of 0.91 at PHS and 0.92 at MIMIC over 6 diseases, comparable to LR and MLP. It had substantially better performance than topic models. In regards to portability, the performance of UNITE was consistent across different EMR systems, superior to LR, topic models and neural network models. Conclusion: UNITE accurately assigns ICD code in EMR without requiring human labor, and has major advantages over commonly used machine learning approaches. In addition, the UNITE attained stable performance and high portability across EMRs in different institutions. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Evidence-based practice is highly dependent upon up-to-date systematic reviews (SR) for decision making. However, conducting and updating systematic reviews, especially the citation screening for identification of relevant studies, requires much human work and is therefore expensive. Automating citation screening using machine learning (ML) based approaches can reduce cost and labor. Machine learning has been applied to automate citation screening but not for the SRs with very narrow research questions. This paper reports the results and observations for an ongoing research that aims to automate citation screening for SRs with narrow research questions using machine learning. The research also sheds light on the problem of class imbalance and class overlap on the performance of ML classifiers when applied to SRs with narrow research questions. © 2020 European Federation for Medical Informatics (EFMI) and IOS Press.

AB  - Purpose: Corrosion loop development is an integral part of the risk-based inspection (RBI) methodology. The corrosion loop approach allows a group of piping to be analyzed simultaneously, thus reducing non-value adding activities by eliminating repetitive degradation mechanism assessment for piping with similar operational and design characteristics. However, the development of the corrosion loop requires rigorous process that involves a considerable amount of engineering man-hours. Moreover, corrosion loop development process is a type of knowledge-intensive work that involves engineering judgement and intuition, causing the output to have high variability. The purpose of this paper is to reduce the amount of time and output variability of corrosion loop development process by utilizing machine learning and group technology method. Design/methodology/approach: To achieve the research objectives, k-means clustering and non-hierarchical classification model are utilized to construct an algorithm that allows automation and a more effective and efficient corrosion loop development process. A case study is provided to demonstrate the functionality and performance of the corrosion loop development algorithm on an actual piping data set. Findings: The results show that corrosion loops generated by the algorithm have lower variability and higher coherence than corrosion loops produced by manual work. Additionally, the utilization of the algorithm simplifies the corrosion loop development workflow, which potentially reduces the amount of time required to complete the development. The application of corrosion loop development algorithm is expected to generate a “leaner” overall RBI assessment process. Research limitations/implications: Although the algorithm allows a part of corrosion loop development workflow to be automated, it is still deemed as necessary to allow the incorporation of the engineer’s expertise, experience and intuition into the algorithm outputs in order to capture tacit knowledge and refine insights generated by the algorithm intelligence. Practical implications: This study shows that the advancement of Big Data analytics and artificial intelligence can promote the substitution of machines for human labors to conduct highly complex tasks requiring high qualifications and cognitive skills, including inspection and maintenance management area. Originality/value: This paper discusses the novel way of developing a corrosion loop. The development of corrosion loop is an integral part of the RBI methodology, but it has less attention among scholars in inspection and maintenance-related subjects. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - LPG utilization need more attention to safety aspects of human, environmental and equipment. This research aims to develop a wheeled robot which is capable of detecting LPG leaks in horizontal pipes by data acquisition via wireless internet, so that it is useful to facilitate human work in determining LPG leak points on horizontal pipes. The controller of this robot is Arduino UNO and equipped with sensors. The sensor measurement data is acquisitioned using the Node MCU module to the Blynk application as an interface application. This robot has an emergency stop feature on the Blynk application. The final results of this research are LPG leak detection robots on horizontal pipes which can provide information on leak points based on gas sensor measurement data and rotary encoder installed on robots with acquisition via wireless internet and data storage on MicroSD. The robot is equipped with buzzer indicator that will sound when a leak is indicated with a gas concentration of more than 30% on one of the gas sensors. Based on the results of final test of the robot, the average value of the leakage point distance obtained is +8.7 cm. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - The functional impact of protein mutations is reflected on the alteration of conformation and thermodynamics of protein–protein interactions (PPIs). Quantifying the changes of two interacting proteins upon mutations is commonly carried out by computational approaches. Hence, extensive research efforts have been put to the extraction of energetic or structural features on proteins, followed by statistical learning methods to estimate the effects of mutations on PPI properties. Nonetheless, such features require extensive human labors and expert knowledge to obtain, and have limited abilities to reflect point mutations. We present an end-to-end deep learning framework, MuPIPR (Mutation Effects in Protein–protein Interaction PRediction Using Contextualized Representations), to estimate the effects of mutations on PPIs. MuPIPR incorporates a contextualized representation mechanism of amino acids to propagate the effects of a point mutation to surrounding amino acid representations, therefore amplifying the subtle change in a long protein sequence. On top of that, MuPIPR leverages a Siamese residual recurrent convolutional neural encoder to encode a wild-type protein pair and its mutation pair. Multilayer perceptron regressors are applied to the protein pair representations to predict the quantifiable changes of PPI properties upon mutations. Experimental evaluations show that, with only sequence information, MuPIPR outperforms various state-of-the-art systems on estimating the changes of binding affinity for SKEMPI v1, and offers comparable performance on SKEMPI v2. Meanwhile, MuPIPR also demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on estimating the changes of buried surface areas.

AB  - Because of the Big Data, artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things all represent potential breakthroughs for productivity and have received considerable attention which has automated many areas of our lives. So, one of these areas is the robot industry. Robots have advanced in significant ways as they have opened technology for exciting new use cases in the supply chain. Mobile autonomous robots can travel through warehouse aisles to execute tasks more efficiently than human labor alone. Pick and store robotize system is a robot car that can follow a deterministic path depending on special algorithms that gives path with the desired specification. Two approaches for automatic storage and retrieval system are produced in this paper: The minimum path approach and the closest first approach. Both approaches use a single mobile robot to store and retrieval several orders to a single received station. In the first approach, the order with the shortest path from the robot to the receiver station through its location is chosen as the first order to be executed. In the second approach, the order with the smallest distance to the robot is executed at first. Several simulation results are tested to show this improvement in length of path and time of arrival. © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - Workplace technologies are more central to working in organisations than ever before. These technologies began as instrumental aids to support office work of individuals but have since also become the basis for social interactions and community building in organisations and more recently become able to perform managerial roles with the use of advanced AI capabilities. Our call for papers to this special issue invited original studies to go further and advance our thinking on the strategic implications of this layered evolution of workplace technologies on work and the structure of organisations. In this introduction, we synthesise the main themes from the special issue, and also ongoing dialogues with the growing community at the regular AIS / IFIP 9.1 workshop on the Changing Nature of Work. A key observation is that the work involved in configuring emergent Digital/Human configurations, is vastly under-reported and poorly understood. Paradoxically, this configuring work is the most demanding and critical in the shaping of modern organisations. We suggest that this type of largely invisible work requires engagement beyond the level of execution or even the meaning of work, it requires intervening with third order effects that get to the core of what an organisation is. We highlight the challenges for organisations in dealing with third order change, particularly because these effects are beyond existing frames of reference and require more dynamic and supple responses based on the values, purpose and intent dominant in the organisation – we describe this as structural digital work. Leaders that are unable or unwilling to engage with effects at this level, and this type of work, will miss identifying core opportunities and risks associated with digital transformation in organisations. We also reflect on the value of current theories and methods used to research this important and emergent phenomenon. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The process of designing hierarchical motion planners typically involves problem-specific intuition and implementations. This process is sub-optimal both in terms of solution space (amount of possibilities for search-space approximations, choice of planner parameters, etc) and amount of human labour. In this paper we show that the design of hierarchical motion planners does not have to be manual. We present a method for parameterizing and then optimizing sequences of problem approximations used in hierarchical motion planning. We define these as a specific kind of graph with intermediate state-spaces and solutions as nodes, and costs and planner parameters as edge properties. These properties become a continuous optimization variable that changes the sequence and parameters of sub-planners in the hierarchy. Using Pareto-front estimation, our method automatically discovers multiple designs of optimal computation-time/motion-cost trade-offs. We evaluate the method on a set of legged robot motion planning problems where hand-designed hierarchies are abundant. Our method discovers sequences of problem approximations which achieve similar'though slightly higher'performance than the best human-designed hierarchies. The performance gain significantly increases on new problems, yielding 12x faster computation times and 10% higher success rates.

AB  - This study aims to contribute empirical evidence to the debate about the future of work in an increasingly robotised world. We implement a data-driven approach to study the technological transition in six leading Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries. First, we perform a cross-country and cross-sector cluster analysis based on the OECD-STAN database. Second, using the International Federation of Robotics database, we bridge these results with those regarding the sectoral density of robots. We show that the process of robotisation is industry-and country-sensitive. In the future, participants in the political and academic debate may be split into optimists and pessimists regarding the future of human labour; however, the two stances may not be contradictory. © 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - Within the next decade, the need for automation, intelligent data handling and pre-processing is expected to increase in order to cope with the vast amount of information generated by a heavily connected and digitalised world. Over the past decades, modern computer networks, infrastructures and digital devices have grown in both complexity and interconnectivity. Cyber security personnel protecting these assets have been confronted with increasing attack surfaces and advancing attack patterns. In order to manage this, cyber defence methods began to rely on automation and (artificial) intelligence supporting the work of humans. However, machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) supported methods have not only been integrated in network monitoring and endpoint security products but are almost omnipresent in any application involving constant monitoring, complex or large volumes of data. Intelligent IDS, automated cyber defence, network monitoring and surveillance as well as secure software development and orchestration are all examples of assets that are reliant on ML and automation. These applications are of considerable interest to malicious actors due to their importance to society. Furthermore, ML and AI methods are also used in audio-visual systems utilised by digital assistants, autonomous vehicles, face-recognition applications and many others. Successful attack vectors targeting the AI of audio-visual systems have already been reported. These attacks range from requiring little technical knowledge to complex attacks hijacking the underlying AI.With the increasing dependence of society on ML and AI, we must prepare for the next generation of cyber attacks being directed against these areas. Attacking a system through its learning and automation methods allows attackers to severely damage the system, while at the same time allowing them to operate covertly. The combination of being inherently hidden through the manipulation made, its devastating impact and the wide unawareness of AI and ML vulnerabilities make attack vectors against AI and ML highly favourable for malicious operators. Furthermore, AI systems tend to be difficult to analyse post-incident as well as to monitor during operations. Discriminating a compromised from an uncompromised AI in real-time is still considered difficult.In this paper, we report on the state of the art of attack patterns directed against AI and ML methods. We derive and discuss the attack surface of prominent learning mechanisms utilised in AI systems. We conclude with an analysis of the implications of AI and ML attacks for the next decade of cyber conflicts as well as mitigations strategies and their limitations. © 2020 NATO CCDCOE.

AB  - Long-distance wireless actuation indicates precise remote control over materials, sensors, and devices that are widely utilized in biomedical, defence, disaster relief, deep ocean, and outer space applications to replace human work. Unlike radio frequency (RF) control, which has low tolerance toward electromagnetic interference (EMI), light control represents a promising method to overcome EMI. Nonetheless, long-distance light-controlled wireless actuation able to compete with RF control has not been achieved until now due to the lack of highly light-sensitive actuator designs. Here, it is demonstrate that amyloid-like protein aggregates can organize photomodule single-layer reduced graphene oxide (rGO) into a well-defined multilayer stack to display long-distance photoactuation. The amyloid-like proteinaceous component docks the rGO layers together to form a hybrid film, which can reliably adhere onto various material surfaces with robust interfacial adhesion. The sensitive photothermal effect and a fast bending in 1 s to switch a circuit are achieved after forming the film on a plastic substrate and irradiating the bilayer film with a blue laser from 100 m away. A photoactuation distance of 50 km can be further extrapolated based on a commercial high-power laser. This study reveals the great potential of amyloid-like aggregates in remote light control of robots and devices. © 2020 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim

AB  - In recent decades, artificial intelligence has demonstrated successful applications in computer vision and natural language processing due to its breakthrough performance. In this paper, we propose a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN)-based method, characterized by acoustic features, for FM broadcast monitoring. The results show that the proposed DCNN model trained with the FBank feature extracted from FM audio files is capable of achieving nearly 100% accuracy in FM station identification tasks. Illegal broadcasting signals are then detected through a comparison with a radio frequency station database. Integrated with the trained DCNN model, an online FM broadcast monitoring system has been successfully implemented and deployed to help reduce human labor and automate the task of FM broadcast monitoring. © 2020.

AB  - With the increasing network topology complexity and continuous evolution of the new wireless technology, it is increasingly challenging to address the network service outage with traditional methods. In order to improve the network operation efficiency, a suitable machine learning technique is used to learn and classify individual base station into different issue based on multiple performance metrics during a specific time window. However an issue classification with supervised learning requires a large amount of labeled dataset, which takes costly human-labor and time to annotate data. To mitigate the cost and time issues, we propose a method based on few-shot learning that uses Prototypical Networks algorithm to complement the eNodeB states analysis. Using dataset from a live LTE network consists of thousand of eNodeB, our experiment results show that the proposed technique provides high performance while using a low number of labeled data. © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - Human-robot collaboration (HRC) is becoming increasingly important as the paradigm of manufacturing is shifting from mass production to mass customization. The introduction of HRC can significantly improve the flexibility and intelligence of automation. To efficiently finish tasks in HRC systems, the robots need to not only predict the future movements of human, but also more high-level plans, i.e., the sequence of actions to finish the tasks. However, due to the stochastic and time-varying nature of human collaborators, it is quite challenging for the robot to efficiently and accurately identify such task plans and respond in a safe manner. To address this challenge, we propose an integrated human-robot collaboration framework. Both plan recognition and trajectory prediction modules are included for the generation of safe and efficient robotic motions. Such a framework enables the robots to perceive, predict and adapt their actions to the human's work plan and intelligently avoid collisions with the human. Moreover, by explicitly leveraging the hierarchical relationship between plans and trajectories, more robust plan recognition performance can be achieved. Physical experiments were conducted on an industrial robot to verify the proposed framework. The results show that the proposed framework could accurately recognize the human workers' plans and thus significantly improve the time efficiency of the HRC team even in the presence of motion classification noises. © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - The solved tasks are to develop recommendations for combining industry 4.0 technologies with the reduction of less qualified personnel due to their use while maximizing (keeping) of the efficiency of the organization's activities. The novelty is the justification for the need to use strategic methodological approaches for design and development of new value proposals and business models in the organization for the strategically effective use of Industry 4.0 technologies and management of highly qualified personnel. The main characteristics, basic technologies and the strategic role of Industry 4.0, as well as its impact on business and working conditions of employees and the state as a whole, are analyzed. The model of changes in the role of labor when using digital capital is analyzed. A full-fledged entry into Industry 4.0 will contribute to various structural and balance changes in the socio-economic sphere, while the main transformations will be subject to the traditional life of a person, his values, beliefs and, ultimately, the conditions of existence. Despite the fact that robotics in the course of Industry 4.0 to replace the individual, the human labour in specific segments will be necessary. Work is also necessary for the development of the individual, both culturally and psychologically. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2020.

AB  - Grains are the consumed food in the world. The local shopkeepers divide the grains by its quality. In the first class quality, grains do not contain unwanted things in it. But it is too costly. So, the local shopkeepers buy the grains of second-class quality and remove the unwanted materials with the help of labors. Human may make mistake in sorting and they also feel tired when they do the same work regularly. This project will reduce the human work by checking its quality and sorting automatically with Eco-Friendly Environment. Here, initially it checks the quality of the grains by image processing and type of grains is detected by machine learning algorithm are proposed in this paper. First step is acquisition of grain image, segmentation, extraction of features. Then the features of grains are given to the CNN classifier for classification and identification of grains type. Different threshold air pressure is required for different types of grains to blow way unwanted grains. The result achieved through neural network will determine threshold pressure of air flow for that particular grain type. When grains comes out through Chute at that instant of time unwanted materials like grains with black skin and over roasted grains are identified by doing image processing using Jetson Nano with camera module. It then removes the unwanted materials by using air blow mechanism where air pressure is determined by CNN. The waste particles in the grains like chickpeas, bengal roasted gram, moong dal, kala chana, etc., and also can be identified and segregated. © 2020 Alpha Publishers. All rights reserved.

AB  - Entity resolution is a well-known challenge in data management for the lack of unique identifiers of records and various errors hidden in the data, undermining the identifiability of entities they refer to. To reveal matching records, every record potentially needs to be compared with all other records in the database, which is computationally intractable even for moderately-sized databases. To circumvent this quadratic challenge, blocking methods are typically employed to facilitate restricting promising comparisons of pairs within small subsets, called blocks, of records. Existing effective methods typically rely on blocking keys created by experts to capture matches, which inevitably involves a large amount of human labor and do not guarantee high-quality results. To reduce manual labor and promote accuracy, machine learning approaches are investigated to meet the challenge with limited success, due to high requirements of training data and inefficiency, especially for large databases. The exhaustive method produces exact results but suffers from efficiency problems. In this paper, we propose a paradigm of divide-and-conquer entity resolution, named recursive blocking, which derives comparatively good results while largely alleviating efficiency concerns. Specifically, recursive blocking refines blocks and traps matches in an iterative fashion to derive high-quality results, and we study two types of recursive blocking, i.e. redundancy- and partition-based approaches, and investigate their relative performance. Comprehensive experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets verified the superiority of our approaches over the existing ones. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Trellised fruiting-wall training systems are becoming standard for modern apple orchards due to their high fruit yield and quality, and their suitability to robotic operations in pruning and harvesting. In a common practice of training young apple trees to a trellis-trained canopy system in PNW region of US, trees branches are manually selected and then tied to horizontal trellis wires in 6 or 7 tiers. As manual training of apple trees to these modern orchard architectures is becoming challenging due to less availability of skilled human labor with quickly increased labor cost, automated training using sensing and robotic techniques could be an alternative solution. Segmenting trunks, branches, and trellis wires is a critical step in automating a tree training operation. In this study, a deep learning-based semantic segmentation method was developed for automatically performing this segmentation task. A Kinect V2 sensor was used to obtain the RGB and point cloud data of target trees. Then both Simple- and Foreground-RGB images were used for training a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based segmentation network (SegNet) to segment the trunk, branch, and trellis wire. Trunks and branches, which share some common features, were segmented from each other with accuracies of 0.82 and 0.89 for Simple-RGB images and 0.91 and 0.92 for Foreground-RGB images, respectively. Similarly, trellis wires, which have distinct features from both the trunk and branches, were segmented with accuracies of 0.92 and 0.97 for the Simple- and Foreground-RGB images, respectively. Obtained results showed that the performance of the developed semantic segmentation technique was better with Foreground-RGB images compared to the same with Simple-RGB images. Accuracy in identifying the segmented region boundaries in Foreground-RGB images, represented by the Boundary-F1 score, was 0.93, 0.89, and 0.91 for the trunk, branch, and trellis wire, respectively. These results showed a promising potential for adopting deep learning-based semantic segmentation for automating apple tree training in orchard environment. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Within digital transformation, which is continuously progressing, robotic process automation (RPA) is drawing much corporate attention. While RPA is a popular topic in the corporate world, the academic research lacks a theoretical and synoptic analysis of RPA. Conducting a literature review and tool analysis, we propose – in a holistic and structured way – four traits that characterize RPA, providing orientation as well as a focus for further research. Software robots automate processes originally performed by human work. Thus, software robots follow a choreography of technological modules and control flow operators while operating within IT ecosystems and using established applications. Ease-of-use and adaptability allow companies to conceive and implement software robots through (agile) projects. Organizational and IT strategy, governance structures, and management systems therefore must address both the direct effects of software robots automating processes and their indirect impacts on firms. © 2019, Institute of Applied Informatics at University of Leipzig.

AB  - In entering the era of Industrial Revolution 4.0, Artificial Intelligence (AI) becames one of Japan's choices after experiencing economic stagnation. Without exception in education, the Japanese government continues to encourage the usage of AI to help human work because it is considered more practical and efficient. Recently, Toda City, Saitama prefecture, Japan has taken the initiative to use AI robots for English conversation classes in elementary schools. AI Robot is considered efficient because English conversation skill in Japanese schools is still lacking, and the practice still relies on the Assistant Language Training (ALT). The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between the usage of AI robots with city revitalization through education. Besides, this study was conducted to find out the effectiveness and weaknesses of AI robots when used in teaching English in schools. This research method is a qualitative method with case studies in Toda Daini Elementary School, Toda City, Saitama Prefecture, Japan, through interviews. Also, Toda City Board of Education's literature data was used for this study. The results of this study show that the usage of AI robots has an effect on city revitalization, and has advantages and disadvantages in implementing English teaching in Japan. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - The 'robot rights' debate, and its related question of 'robot responsibility', invokes some of the most polarized positions in AI ethics. While some advocate for granting robots rights on a par with human beings, others, in a stark opposition argue that robots are not deserving of rights but are objects that should be our slaves. Grounded in post-Cartesian philosophical foundations, we argue not just to deny robots 'rights', but to deny that robots, as artifacts emerging out of and mediating human being, are the kinds of things that could be granted rights in the first place. Once we see robots as mediators of human being, we can understand how the 'robots rights' debate is focused on first world problems, at the expense of urgent ethical concerns, such as machine bias, machine elicited human labour exploitation, and erosion of privacy all impacting society's least privileged individuals. We conclude that, if human being is our starting point and human welfare is the primary concern, the negative impacts emerging from machinic systems, as well as the lack of taking responsibility by people designing, selling and deploying such machines, remains the most pressing ethical discussion in AI. © 2020 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - In countries like India road maintenance is a challenging task. Year after year, the accident rates are increasing due to the up-surging potholes count. As the road maintenance process is done manually in most places, it consumes enormous time, requires human labor and subjected to human errors. Thus, there is a growing need for a cost-effective automated identification of potholes. In recent trends, many approaches proved good results in applying deep learning [1] for different object detection. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have the ability to learn the art of extracting relevant features from an Image. But in countries like India, there is no potholes dataset available to train the CNN. In this paper, a new 1500 image dataset has been created on Indian roads. The dataset is annotated and trained using YOLO (You Only Look Once). The new dataset is trained on YOLOv3, YOLOv2, YOLOv3-tiny, and the results are compared. The results are evaluated based on the mAP, precision and recall. The model is tested on different pothole images and it detects with a reasonable accuracy. © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to approach the issue of taxation of robotic process automation (RPA) through an interpretive lens provided by both Adam Smith and Karl Marx. Both scholars have affected the understanding and attitudes of generations of economists, and their ideas have considerable influenced modern economic policy. It will be argued that Smith and Marx have much to offer to help contemporary economists understand the taxation of RPA, and their writings on machines, automation, and their impact on the human labor force will be discussed from their primary texts. Design/methodology/approach: The paper interprets the works of Marx and Smith in relation to contemporary debates on automation, particularly, proposals to tax technological innovations to offset the social costs of automation’s displacement effects. Findings: In the case of Adam Smith, there is not enough evidence to suggest that he would support a specific taxation of RPA; however, he very well might agree with a modest taxation of capital goods. Marx would very likely support a taxation in the short-run, however, would be inclined to caution that the ownership of robots should in the long run be transferred to society. Originality/value: This paper uses primary texts from the discipline of history of economic thought to spark a discussion about compensating the externalities of technological innovation. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - A fusion of LiDAR and cameras have been widely used in many robotics applications such as classification, segmentation, object detection, and autonomous driving. It is essential that the LiDAR sensor can measure distances accurately, which is a good complement to the cameras. Hence, calibrating sensors before deployment is a mandatory step. The conventional methods include checkerboards, specific patterns, or human labeling, which is trivial and human-labor extensive if we do the same calibration process every time. The main purpose of this research work is to build a deep neural network that is capable of automatically finding the geometric transformation between LiDAR and cameras. The results show that our model manages to find the transformations from randomly sampled artificial errors. Besides, our work is open-sourced for the community to fully utilize the advances of the methodology for developing more the approach, initiating collaboration, and innovation in the topic. © 2020 IEEE

AB  - For tree counting tasks, since traditional image processing methods require expensive feature engineering and are not end-to-end frameworks, this will cause additional noise and cannot be optimized overall, so this method has not been widely used in recent trends of tree counting application. Recently, many deep learning based approaches are designed for this task because of the powerful feature extracting ability. The representative way is bounding box based supervised method, but time-consuming annotations are indispensable for them. Moreover, these methods are difficult to overcome the occlusion or overlap. To solve this problem, we propose a weakly tree counting network (WTCNet) based on deep segmentation network with only point supervision. It can simultaneously complete tree counting with localization and output mask of each tree at the same time. We first adopt a novel feature extractor network (FENet) to get features of input images, and then an effective strategy is introduced to deal with different mask predictions. In the end, we propose a basic localization guidance accompany with rectification guidance to train the network. We create two different datasets and select an existing challenging plant dataset to evaluate our method on three different tasks. Experimental results show the good performance improvement of our method compared with other existing methods. Further study shows that our method has great potential to reduce human labor and provide effective ground-truth masks and the results show the superiority of our method over the advanced methods. © 2021 IEEE

AB  - New technologies are ever evolving and have the power to change human work for the better or the worse depending on the implementation. For human–robot interaction (HRI), it is decisive how humans and robots will share tasks and who will be in charge for decisions on task allocation. The aim of this online experiment was to examine the influence of different decision agents on the perception of a task allocation process in HRI. We assume that inclusion of the worker in the allocation will create more perceived work resources and will lead to more satisfaction with the allocation and the work results than a decision made by another agent. To test these hypotheses, we used a fictional production scenario where tasks were allocated to the participant and a robot. The allocation decision was either made by the robot, by an organizational unit, or by the participants themselves. We then looked for differences between those conditions. Our sample consisted of 151 people. In multiple ANOVAs, we could show that satisfaction with the allocation process, the solution, and with the result of the work process was higher in the condition where participants themselves were given agency in the allocation process compared to the other two. Those participants also experienced more task identity and autonomy. This has implications for the design of allocation processes: The inclusion of workers in task allocation can play a crucial role in leveraging the acceptance of HRI and in designing humane work systems in Industry 4.0. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - New technologies have an ambiguous impact on the labor market, therefore, the possibility of sustainable development of modern society in the context of a radical transformation of the nature and content of labor is today the subject of controversy among world scientists and experts. Technological innovations of the last century reduced to a minimum jobs in labor-intensive sectors of the economy (for example, in agriculture), contributed to an increase in labor productivity, which allowed developed countries to invest in high technologies. The current stage of technological development is of a stochastic nature - new sectors of the economy appear unexpectedly, but grow very rapidly. Given the unpredictability of short-term and Long-team demand in the world's labor markets, social instability in the world is growing. The article substantiates the need to adapt society to new technologies that replace human labor by developing cognitive competencies, creative abilities, and strategic thinking. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2020.

AB  - With the flourish of differentiable neural architecture search (NAS), automatically searching latency-constrained architectures gives a new perspective to reduce human labor and expertise. However, the searched architectures are usually suboptimal in accuracy and may have large jitters around the target latency. In this paper, we rethink three freedoms of differentiable NAS, i.e. operation-level, depth-level and width-level, and propose a novel method, named Three-Freedom NAS (TF-NAS), to achieve both good classification accuracy and precise latency constraint. For the operation-level, we present a bi-sampling search algorithm to moderate the operation collapse. For the depth-level, we introduce a sink-connecting search space to ensure the mutual exclusion between skip and other candidate operations, as well as eliminate the architecture redundancy. For the width-level, we propose an elasticity-scaling strategy that achieves precise latency constraint in a progressively fine-grained manner. Experiments on ImageNet demonstrate the effectiveness of TF-NAS. Particularly, our searched TF-NAS-A obtains 76.9% top-1 accuracy, achieving state-of-the-art results with less latency.

Although labor force participation rates and firms' job vacancies for human labor decline, the unemployment rate may be lower than that in an economy without AI. In an economy with heterogeneously skilled workers, the invention of AI usually has a negative effect on the skilled labor market but a positive effect on the unskilled labor market. The overall unemployment rate may decline as AI develops. © 2020 Cambridge University Press.

AB  - It is hard to evaluate the quality of the generated text by a generative dialogue system. Currently, dialogue evaluation relies on human judges to label the quality of the generated text. It is not a reusable mechanism that can give consistent evaluation for system developers. We believe that it is easier to get consistent results on comparing two generated dialogue by two systems and it is hard to give a consistent quality score on only one system at a time. In this paper, we propose a machine learning approach to reduce the effort of human evaluation by learning the human judgment on comparing two dialogue systems. Training from the human labeling result, the evaluation model learns which generative models is better in each dialog context. Thus, it can be used for system developers to compare the fine-tuned models over and over again without the human labor. In our experiment we find the agreement between the learned model and human judge is 70%. The experiment is conducted on comparing two attention based GRU-RNN generative models. © European Language Resources Association (ELRA), licensed under CC-BY-NC

AB  - Classification is a significant step in the commercial processing of apple after harvest, however, at present, there are some problems in apple detection and classification, such as the simplification of detection index, relying on artificial classification and so on. With the development of robot technology, it has a good prospect to use manipulator to replace human labor to detect and classify apples. In order to realize automatic on-line detection and classification for apples, this study proposed an on-line detection and classification manipulator system for apples. Based on machine vision and optical technology, the system can detect the internal and external quality of apple at the same time. The system can divide apples into four levels referring to their internal and external quality. The manipulator consisted of an end effector and a six DOF mechanical arm, which can complete the grasping, transferring and placing of apple. The end actuator integrated the gripping mechanism and the near-infrared (NIR) detection module to realize the simultaneous grip and detection of the apple. The system used a CCD camera to get the image, and the image processing method was performed to get the apple position, diameter and other information after that. A spectrometer was used to collect the spectral data of 100 apples in 650-1100nm wavelength range. Spectrum collection and modeling in two different states of normal work state and step motor power off state were carried out, respectively. The SSC values of these 100 apple samples were measured immediately after that using the destructive method. And then the PLS regression model of SSC was established. Comparing the different modeling results, it showed that the griping process have no negative effect to the NIR acquisition process. Which illustrated the rationality of two process working at the same time. The results of SG smoothing and multiple scattering correction (MSC) preprocessing were that Rp = 0.9522 and RMSEp = 0.4492%. When the system works, the model can be invoked to predict the SSC value of apple. After testing the system function, the detection and classification function had been basically realized, which can replace the human labor to realize automatic detection and classification for apples. This system had stable and reliable performance, which can provide a new design method for fruit on-line nondestructive detection and classification equipment. © ASABE 2020 Annual International Meeting.

AB  - Robots in the industry have been used for decades, much before the so-called Fourth Industrial Revolution. They have been incorporated into industrial processes in various ways, for example, with mechanic arms, in assembly processes, welding, and painting, among others. Industrial robots are located in restricted access sites and their space is delimited by means of physical barriers and security measures. In recent years, Industry 4.0 proposes the use robots, able to collaborate with persons, known as collaborative robots or “cobots”. Cobots are characterized by cooperating with human work, sharing the same workspace, and able to respond to simple human-machine interactions. In addition, given the benefits of applying cloud computing in Industry 4.0, research has been conducted in applying such technologies to robots. The approach is known as “cloud robotics” and appears as an emerging topic. The objective of this work is to carry out a systematic literature review of cloud robotics for Industry 4.0, in an attempt to present the state of the art in this field and identify opportunities for future research. From the analysis of the results, we observe an emerging interest in this area, and we identify main technologies applied, research themes, and application areas, as well as a special interest on security and safety aspects. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Manufacturing has evolved to become more automated in pursuit of higher quality, better productivity and lower cost. However, industrial logistics between the end customer and manufacturing supply chain still demands human labor and intelligence. This logistic work requires engineers with experienced knowledge to identify machining processes from the CAD model provided by customers at the beginning, and later sourcing for qualified manufacturing suppliers according to identified manufacturing processes. Developing an efficient automatic Machining Process Identification (MPI) system becomes a pivotal problem for logistic automation. In this paper, a novel MPI system is presented based on 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Transfer learning. The proposed system admits triangularly tessellated surface (STL) models as inputs and outputs machining process labels (e.g. milling, turning etc.) as the results of classification of the neural network. Computer-synthesized workpiece models are utilized in training the neural network. In addition to the MPI system, a portable framework was developed for future applications in related fields. The MPI system shows more than 98% accuracy for both synthesized models and real workpiece models which verifies its robustness and real-time reliability. © 2020 The Authors.

AB  - Robotic Process Automation (RPA) is one of the fastest growing segments in the enterprise IT space enabling the automation of repetitive tasks performed by humans. RPA is usually applied to various business processes and activities in sales, customer relationship management, support functions, etc. A service quotation generation (SQG) is a process often used in sales market for creating a service quotation, tracking it, and, after acceptance, transferring it to a service order. SQG can be designed in different ways and for different purposes, but in general it is repetitive and rule based process thus a good candidate for RPA. In this paper RPA approach is proposed for automated service quotation generation. The time-effectiveness of the proposed technology was tested with different amount of tasks (cases). Results obtained through automation are superior more than 2 times to those achieved by human labour. © 2020 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

AB  - Deep learning has the ability to mine complex relationships in fault diagnosis. Deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) with deep structures, instead of shallow ones, can be applied to mining useful information from the original vibration data. However, when the number of the training samples is small, the diagnosis accuracy will be affected. As an improvement of the DCNN, deep convolutional neural network based on the Fisher-criterion (FDCNN) can be used for the fault diagnosis of small samples. But the model parameters in the method are based on human labor or prior knowledge, which is bound to bring negative influence on the diagnosis accuracy. Therefore, a novel adaptive Fisher-based deep convolutional neural network (AFDCNN) method, which can optimize the model parameters adaptively, is proposed as an improvement of the FDCNN. Comparative verification test results show that AFDCNN has more outstanding performance. © 2020 Peng Luo et al.

AB  - Machine learning approaches for manufacturing usually offer recommendation lists, e.g., to support humans in fault diagnosis. For instance, if a product does not pass the final check after the assembly, a recommendation list may contain likely faulty product components to be replaced. Thereby, the list ranks these components using their probabilities. However, these probabilities often differ marginally, while economic impacts, e.g., the costs for replacing components, differ significantly. We address this issue by proposing an approach that incorporates costs to re-rank an initial list. Our evaluation shows that this approach reduces fault-related costs when using recommendation lists to support human labor. © 2020 The Authors.

AB  - The overwhelming manufacturing process with robotic arm has replaced human labors in handling and manufacturing work-pieces in factories. In these years, higher accuracy and repeatability are required for robotic manipulators to perform processes such as welding, deburring and grinding in factories. In these path-following processes, the manipulator’s end-effector often encounter position error caused by its vibrating structures. Therefore, the quality of machining accuracy and surface roughness becomes unstable and unsatisfied. For the purpose of avoiding the vibrations to occur in the robotic manipulator, this study aims to design a control method to reduce vibrations which is divided into two parts, namely (1) dynamic modeling the robot arm by applying modified mass-spring-damper model to each joints and links of the robot arm, and (2) realizing the control of the robot arm’s vibration resistance with predicated dynamics to compensate for the undesired dynamics, respectively. Through the proposed model, the response of each joints in different postures and different payloads applied at the end effector can be fully analyzed and the vibrations can be predicted and compensated. Results with the proposed vibration resistance control method indicate improvement of the model robot arm’s dynamic position error. Copyright © 2020 ASME.

AB  - Several studies have shown that the phone number and call behavior generated by a phone call reveal the type of phone call. By analyzing the phone number rules and call behavior patterns, we can recognize the fraudulent phone call. The success of this recognition heavily depends on the particular set of features that are used to construct the classifier. Since these features are human-labor engineered, any change introduced to the telephone fraud can render these carefully constructed features ineffective. In this paper, we show that we can automate the feature engineering process and, thus, automatically recognize the fraudulent phone call by applying our proposed novel approach based on deep learning. We design and construct a new classifier based on Call Detail Records (CDR) for fraudulent phone call recognition and find that the performance achieved by our deep learning-based approach outperforms competing methods. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Specifically, in our accuracy evaluation, the obtained accuracy exceeds 99%, and the most performant deep learning model is 4.7% more accurate than the state-of-the-art recognition model on average. Furthermore, we show that our deep learning approach is very stable in real-world environments, and the implicit features automatically learned by our approach are far more resilient to dynamic changes of a fraudulent phone number and its call behavior over time. We conclude that the ability to automatically construct the most relevant phone number features and call behavior features and perform accurate fraudulent phone call recognition makes our deep learning-based approach a precise, efficient, and robust technique for fraudulent phone call recognition. © 2020 Jian Xing et al.

AB  - Considering the fact that the initiative Industry 4.0 started in the Czech Republic in 2016, it is still a relatively unexplored topic. However, there is a significant lack of researches, which examines the perception of Industry 4.0 by employees whose jobs are directly threatened by Industry 4.0. The aim of the paper was found out how Czech employees perceive Industry 4.0 and whether a general pattern can be created for a group of employees who perceive it as a potential threat to their existence based on their characteristics (age, gender, education, and the job position). Information about this initiative is often tendentiously presented by media, even managers don't have precise information about the benefits and outcomes of Industry 4.0. Industry 4.0 from the employees' point of view is connected with job loss or substitution of human work by robots. And this state might build barriers to implementation Industry 4.0. © 2020 Mendel University of Agriculture and Forestry Brno. All rights reserved.

AB  - Greenhouses in China frequently use manual control curtains that are switched by experience. This approach is not just time consuming and laborious but lacks scientific control. Most existing agricultural greenhouse control systems use a single control mode for a specified variable but lacking an intelligent control system that can integrate several important parameters and operate accurately. This article proposes the greenhouse control system model based on the switch mechanism. The technique is used to employ a newly developed and versatile switch control algorithm as the basic structure to comprehensively consider greenhouse environmental parameters such as the outdoor temperature, outdoor light intensity, indoor humidity, indoor light intensity, indoor temperature and CO2 concentration and to control. A model is designed for a complex and changeable parameter analysis using the fuzzy control method, which can combine these estimates and produce the control intelligence. The system of feedback control in a greenhouse including the heater fan, humidifier, rolling machine, artificial light and CO2 gas cylinder control equipment enables the comprehensive and intelligent management of the crop growth environment. The results of an experimental analysis procedure are delivered to illustrate the proposed technique. The results show that the minimum temperature increases by 5℃ and the maximum temperature decreases by 4℃ within 24 h, causing the temperature to be closer to the expected range. The average air humidity reduces from 86.6% to 73.3%. The amount of CO2 consumed by crops and the effective illumination time increases. The system can effectively reduce the intensity of human labor and accurately and efficiently regulate the growth environment of crops in a greenhouse. © 2020 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers.

AB  - With the continuous development and progress of science and technology, artificial intelligence (AI) has gradually become a part of the field of literary and artistic creation. In this process, more AI works of art have emerged at key moments. As a result, discussions of the evaluation of AI-produced art have become richer and richer. At present, when discussing whether or not works created by AI are art, the biggest controversy relates to whether AI creations can express emotions, as human art can. No textual research has yet been conducted on this topic. Although a few studies have explored the emotions elicited by AI works of art, most have focused on the identity cognition of AI and human artists. This research proposes a novel approach to artistic aesthetic experience to explore two research questions, as follows: 1) What types of emotional responses do observers have when they encounter works of art created by artificial intelligence? 2) Is there a significant difference in observers’ emotional responses to AI works of art and the works of human artists? In this study, the abstract works of art created by human artists and AI are used as the primary image stimulation, and the Geneva Emotion Wheel created by the Swiss Emotional Research Center is used as the basic measuring tool, allowing the study participants to choose from 20 emotion types and 5 intensity levels. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

AB  - The quality and accessibility of modern financial service have been quickly and dramatically improved, which benefits from the fast development of information technology. It has also witnessed the trend for applying artificial intelligence related technology, especially machine learning to the finance and security industry ranging from face recognition to fraud detection. In particular, deep neural networks have proven to be far superior to traditional algorithms in various application scenarios of computer vision. In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based video analysis system for automated compliance audit in stock brokerage, which in general consists of five modules here: 1) Video tampering and integrity detection; 2) Objects of interest localization and association; 3) Analysis of presence and departure of personnel in a video; 4) Face image quality assessment; and 5) Signature action positioning. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that introduces remote automated compliance audit system for the dual-recorded video in finance and security industry. The experimental results suggest our system can identify most of the potential non-compliant videos and has greatly improved the working efficiency of the auditors and reduced human labor costs. The collected dataset in our experiment will be released with this paper. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Online review platforms provide enormous information for users to evaluate products and services. However, the sheer volume of reviews can create information overload that could increase user search costs and cognitive burden. To reduce information overload, in this paper, we propose an Automatic Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (AABSA) model to automatically identify key aspects from Chinese online reviews and conduct aspect-based sentiment analysis. We create a hierarchical structure of hypernyms and hyponyms, apply deep-learning-based representation learning and clustering to identify aspects that are the core content in the reviews, and then calculate the sentiment score of each aspect. To evaluate the performance of the identied aspects, we use an econometric model to estimate the impact of each aspect on product sales. We collaborate with one of Asia's largest online shopping platforms and employ the model in its product review tagging system to help consumers search for product aspects. Compared with benchmark models, our model is both more eective, because it creates a more comprehensive list of aspects that are indicative of customer needs, and more efficient because it is fully automated without any human labor cost. © 2020 CEUR Workshop Proceedings.

AB  - The road centerline extraction is the key step of the road network extraction and modeling. The hand-craft feature engineering in the traditional road extraction methods is unstable, which makes the extracted road centerline deviated from the road center in complex cases and even results in overall extracting errors. Recently, the road centerline extraction methods based on semantic segmentation employing deep neural network greatly outperformed the traditional methods. Nevertheless, the pixel-wise labels for training deep learning models are expensive and the postprocess of road segmentation is error-prone. Inspired by the work of human pose estimation, we propose DeepWindow, a novel method to automatically extract the road network from remote sensing images. DeepWindow uses a sliding window guided by a CNN-based decision function to track the road network directly from the images without the prior of road segmentation. First of all, we design and train a CNN model to estimate the road center points inside a patch. Then, the road seeds are automatically searched patch by patch employing the CNN model. Finally, starting from seeds, our method first estimates the road direction using a Fourier spectrum analysis algorithm and then iteratively tracks the road center-line along the road direction guided by the CNN model. In our method, the CNN model is trained by point annotations, which greatly reduces the training costs comparing to those in semantic model training. Our method achieves comparable performance with the state-of-the-art road extraction methods, and extensive experiments indicate that our method is robust to the point deviation. © 2008-2012 IEEE.

AB  - To improve human performance, interactive technologies are going towards more automated systems that involve computers, robots and cyber-physical systems into the decision-making process. While automation can lead to increased performance and reduced impact of human errors, interactive technologies without optimal design can have a negative impact on the experience of operators and end-users, leading to suboptimal performance of the automated systems. In this research, we aim to evaluate and refine Human Work Interaction Design (HWID) framework to be applicable in various highly-automated settings including Industry 4.0 environments. This will be performed via a thorough literature review as the first step. The list of identified factors playing a potential role in various interactive systems will then be evaluated and optimised in three case studies. We will try to understand how to maximise collaborations between the users and the machine in interactive systems. A practical approach for evaluating both employees’ and end-users’ perspectives in three scenarios with different levels of automation will be assessed. We will evaluate the outputs in multiple levels of organisations, employees and end-users. The ultimate output of the study will be a framework or model that will help in designing future research studies for various automation scenarios, especially semi-autonomous systems that involve high levels of interaction between users and the machine. We will provide guidelines for implementation of the proposed framework in different scenarios. We expect that the framework output of this research will provide a comprehensive guideline applicable to many Industry 4.0 technologies. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2020.

AB  - This article draws on the sociology of expectations to examine the construction of expectations of ‘ethical AI’ and considers the implications of these expectations for communication governance. We first analyse a range of public documents to identify the key actors, mechanisms and issues which structure societal expectations around artificial intelligence (AI) and an emerging discourse on ethics. We then explore expectations of AI and ethics through a survey of members of the public. Finally, we discuss the implications of our findings for the role of AI in communication governance. We find that, despite societal expectations that we can design ethical AI, and public expectations that developers and governments should share responsibility for the outcomes of AI use, there is a significant divergence between these expectations and the ways in which AI technologies are currently used and governed in large scale communication systems. We conclude that discourses of ‘ethical AI’ are generically performative, but to become more effective we need to acknowledge the limitations of contemporary AI and the requirement for extensive human labour to meet the challenges of communication governance. An effective ethics of AI requires domain appropriate AI tools, updated professional practices, dignified places of work and robust regulatory and accountability frameworks. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Advances in robotics promote interest in applications in the poultry industry to reduce human labor; however, skeptics express concerns regarding potential animal stress stemming from poultry-robot interactions. The objective of this study was to evaluate the avoidance distance (AD), a parameter reflecting stress in an animal due to an approaching object, of broilers and laying hens to a human assessor and a robotic ground vehicle. ADs were determined for birds at different ages (2, 4, 6, and 8 week old broilers; 28, 47, and 66 week old brown hens; and 27, 46, and 70 week old white hens) in a commercial broiler house and two commercial cage-free hen houses. The poultry-robot ADs were determined at three robot operating speeds (0.2, 0.4, and 0.6 m s-1) and two operation frequencies (bi-weekly and daily, for broilers only). The results show that the overall poultry-human and poultry-robot ADs were, respectively, 48 to 82 cm and 83 to 110 cm for broilers, 54 to 87 cm and 114 to 131 cm for brown hens, and 71 to 76 cm and 92 to 99 cm for white hens when the birds experienced the robot on test days only. Broiler-robot ADs significantly decreased to 30 to 63 cm when the birds were exposed to the robot daily, reflecting less stress induced by the robot than by the human. Poultry ADs to the human and robot tended to decrease for older birds. Slower robot operating speeds led to shorter ADs for broilers at 6 and 8 weeks of age and for white hens at all ages but did not affect ADs for broilers at 2 and 4 weeks of age and brown hens at all ages. Slower robot operating speeds also reduced the bird fleeing speed (FS). It is concluded that the robot did not induce more stress than the human in the broilers. The baseline poultry-robot ADs obtained in this study provide valuable information for understanding poultry interactions with robots and may help optimize robot operations for application in the poultry industry. © 2020 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers.

AB  - A new trend in robotic cells is the Human-Robot Collaboration (HRC) in which robots and humans work together. Cyber-Physical Production Systems (CPPS) and Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) will improve the flexibility of the future production systems in the newest smart factories. IEC-61499 is a standard based in Functions Blocks (FBs) that use reusable and modularised software to design industrial control systems. The use of FBs is suitable to implement CPPS. The proposal of this paper is to show architecture and implementation of a robot control system based on the IEC-61499 standard over the Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol for HRC. An industrial robot based CPPS for HRC is decomposed into FBs to accomplish welding tasks. A study case is used to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed system. Results show that the FB based CPPS for robot control possesses the potential capability for the welding process based on HRC. © 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This paper aims to show how the frequently asked question about the future of work, that is, whether human beings are going to be replaced by machines and robots, arose, and why the way such question is posed is inadequate to account for the human and social value of care professions. We discuss how the dimensions entailed in care professions are specifically human and argue that any kind of human work actually reflects them (and will reflect them in the future), irrespective of the impact of technological changes. The present argument also aims to unveil the extent of the effects of the postmodern epistemological crisis regarding the concept of work, to reformulate the question about the future of human work, and to offer a characterization of care as a specific component of human work in the age of machines. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - This paper proposes a system that uses visual servos in service robots to improve the accuracy of disposal work in retail stores. In recent years, service robots that can support human work have become expected. In particular, it would be useful to apply a robot system that includes a service robot system to daily work such as retail display and disposal tasks. However, there are several problems; one is that the positioning accuracy of object manipulation can be low because of mechanical stiffness. To address this problem, we employ a technology called visual servoing, which has been widely applied in the arms of industrial and other types of robots, to the control of double-armed service robots. Our developed robot system is constructed using a robotics middleware platform, because of its software reusability. The experimental results confirm the effectiveness of developed system for stable disposal operations. © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - This article investigates public opinion about smart robots, with special focus on the ethical dimension. In so doing, the study reviews relevant literature and analyzes data from the comments sections of four publically available online news articles on smart robots. Findings from the content analysis of investigated comments suggest that public opinion about smart robots remains fairly negative, and that public discussion is focused on potentially negative social and economic impacts of smart robots on society, as well as various liability issues. In particular, many comments were what can only be called “apocalyptical”, suggesting that the rise of smart robots is a threat to the very existence of human beings, and that the replacement of human labour by smart robots will lead to deepening the socio-economic gap, and concentrating power and wealth in the hands of even fewer people. Further, public discussion seems to pay little attention to the debate on whether robots should have “rights”, or on the increasing environmental effects of the growth in robotics. This study contributes to the extant literature on “roboethics”, by suggesting a dendrogram approach to illustrate themes based on a qualitative content analysis. It suggests that smart robot manufacturers should ensure better transparency and inclusion in their robotics design processes to foster public adoption of robots. © 2012 Universidad Autonoma del Estado de Mexico.

AB  - Urban villages emerge with the rapid urbanization process in many developing countries, and bring serious social and economic challenges to urban authorities, such as overcrowding and low living standards. A comprehensive understanding of the locations and regional boundaries of urban villages in a city is crucial for urban planning and management, especially when urban authorities need to renovate these regions. Traditional methods greatly rely on surveys and investigations of city planners, which consumes substantial time and human labor. In this work, we propose a low-cost and automatic framework to accurately identify urban villages from high-resolution remote sensing satellite imagery. Specifically, we leverage the Mask Regional Convolutional Neural Network (Mask-RCNN) model for end-to-end urban village detection and segmentation. We evaluate our framework on the city-wide satellite imagery of Xiamen, China. Results show that our framework successfully detects 87.18% of the urban villages in the city, and accurately segments their regional boundaries with an IoU of 74.48%. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Robots are the most important innovation which has affected the production process in the last three decades. Thanks to the latest advances in technology, they have been able to perform an ever-increasing number of tasks, eventually replacing human work within the whole production process. However, because of the scarcity of suitable data, the extent of this potentially disrupting process is not fully assessed. This paper makes up for the lack of empirical evidence on the effect of robotization on labour dislocation using data collected by the International Federation of Robotics (IFR) on the number of robots installed in the different manufacturing industries of 16 OECD countries over the period 2011–2016. We show that at the industry level a 1% growth in the number of robots reduces the growth rate of worked hours by 0.16, as well as the selling prices and the real values of the compensations of employees. Moreover, we show that a given sector is more likely to be robotized when it is expanding both in terms of relative prices and employee compensations. We conclude that, at least in the selected countries, the introduction of robots plays a key role in slowing down human labour and compensation growth. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The digitized text of handwriting would conduce to automate the business processes of many companies, simplifying the work of human being. For example, our state postal service does not have an automated mail processing system that recognizes handwritten addresses on an envelope. Each incoming correspondence is registered in the system by the operator. Automation of this business process on registering post mailing will significantly reduce expenses of postal service on mail delivery.There are two main approaches to handwriting recognition, namely hidden Markov models (HMM) and artificial neural networks (ANN). The methods proposed in this article are based on ANN. The first model is based on deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) [1] for feature extraction and a fully connected multilayer perceptron (fully connected MLP) for word classification. The next model under consideration, called SimpleHTR, proposed by Harald Scheidl [2], has layers of a convolutional neural network (CNN) and layers of a recurrent neural network (RNN) for disseminating information through an image. Finally, the Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) decoding algorithm is executed, which adduces the text to the final version.Models were learned on the dataset of handwritten city names from Cyrillic words. 21, 000 images were collected (42 classes of 500 handwriting samples). To increase the data set for training, 207, 438 images from available samples were generated.As a result, two approaches for handwriting recognition were analyzed and the SimpleHTR model showed the best results over all. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - The use of robots in the national economy—especially in industrialized countries—is growing. At the same time, the interdependency between humans and robots is getting increasingly closer: they are engaging in direct contact with each other as more and more organizations let robots and humans work hand-in-hand. One factor that predicts successful human–robot interdependency is the acceptance of the robot by the human. Generally, only when an innovative assistive working system covers human needs and expectations, it is perceived to be useful and hence accepted. Furthermore, it has been found that cultural context has an impact on human–robot interaction, as people feel more comfortable interacting with a robot in a culturally normative way. Therefore this paper aims at presenting a human–robot collaboration acceptance model (HRCAM) with regard to the collaboration between humans and robots that is based on prior acceptance models, while also considering technology affinity and ethical, legal and social implications. Additionally, similarities and differences in robot acceptance are shown for four selected countries—both in comparison to the overall human–robot collaboration acceptance model and between the countries. The HRCAM additionally shows which variables influence perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use, and thus behavioral intention to use and use behavior. A further distinction is made between anchor variables, which can be influenced in the long term, and adjustment variables, which can be influenced in the short to medium term. The model therefore offers practitioners in the field of human–robot collaboration recommendations to increase the acceptance of robots. © 2019, The Author(s).

AB  - Nowadays humanoid robots have generally made dramatic progress, which can form a coalition replacing human work in dangerous environments such as rescue, defense, exploration, etc. In contrast to other types of robots, humanoid robots’ similarity to human make them more suitable for performing such a wide range of tasks. Rescue applications for robots, especially for humanoid robots are exciting. In rescue operating conditions, tasks’ dependencies, tasks’ repetitive accomplishment requirements, robots’ energy consumption, and total tasks’ accomplishment time are key factors. This paper investigates a practical variant of the Multi-Robots Task Allocation (MRTA) problem for humanoid robots as multi-humanoid robots’ task allocation (MHTA) problem. In order to evaluate relevant aspects of the MHTA problem, we proposed a robust Multi-Objective Multi-Humanoid Robots Task allocation (MO-MHTA) algorithm with four objectives, namely energy consumption, total tasks’ accomplishment time, robot’s idle time and fairness were optimized simultaneously in an evolutionary framework in MO-MHTA, which address for the first time. MO-MHTA exhibits multi-objective properties in real-world applications for humanoid robots in two phases. In the first phase, the tasks are partitioned in a fair manner with a proposed constraint k-medoid (CKM) algorithm. In the second phase, a new non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm with special genetic operators is applied. Evaluations based on extensive experiments on the newly proposed benchmark instances with three robust multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) are applied. The proposed algorithm achieves favorable results in comparison to six other algorithms. Besides, the proposed algorithm can be seen as benchmark algorithms for real-world MO-MHTA instances. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Today, the diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) has attracted the attention of researchers in this field owing to the increase in the occurrence of the diseases and the need for early diagnosis. Unfortunately, the nature of high dimension of neural data and few available samples led to the creation of a precise computer diagnostic system. Machine learning techniques, especially deep learning, have been considered as a useful tool in this field. Inspired by the concept of unsupervised feature learning that uses artificial intelligence to learn features from raw data, a two-stage method was presented for an intelligent diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease. At the first stage of learning, scattered filtering, an uncontrolled two-layer neural network was used to directly learn features from raw data. At the second stage, SoftMax regression was used to categorize health statuses based on the learned features. The proposed method was validated by the data sets of Alzheimer’s Brain Images. The results showed that the proposed method achieved very good diagnostic accuracy and was better than the existing methods for brain image data sets. The proposed method reduces the need for human work and makes it easy to intelligently diagnose for big data processing, because the learning features are adaptive. In our experiments with the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) data, a dual and multi-class classification was conducted for AD/MCI diagnosis and the superiority of the proposed method in comparison with the advanced methods was shown. © 2019, The Author(s).

AB  - For alleviating the human labor associated with annotating the training data for learning object detectors, recent research has focused on semi-supervised object detection (SSOD) and weakly supervised object detection (WSOD) approaches. In SSOD, instead of annotating all the instances in the whole training set, people only need to annotate the part of the training instances using bounding boxes. In WSOD, people need to annotate the image-level tags on all training images to indicate the object categories contained by the corresponding images since more detailed bounding box annotations are no longer needed. Along this line of research, this paper makes a further step to alleviate the human labor in annotating training data, leading to the problem of object detection with semi-annotated weak labels (ODSAWLs). Instead of labeling image-level tags on all training images, ODSAWL only needs the image-level tags for a small portion of the training images, and then, the object detectors can be learned from a small portion of the weakly-labeled training images and from the remaining unlabeled training images. To address such a challenging problem, this paper proposes a cross model co-training framework that collaborates an object localizer and a tag generator in an alternative optimization procedure. Specifically, during the learning procedure, these two (deep) models can transfer the needed knowledge (including labels and visual patterns) between each other. The whole learning procedure is accomplished in a few stages under the guidance of a progressive learning curriculum. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we implement the comprehensive experiments on three benchmark datasets, where the obtained experimental results are quite encouraging. Notably, by using only about 15% weakly labeled training images, the proposed approach can effectively approach, or even outperform, the state-of-the-art WSOD methods. © 1991-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Cleaning requirements of glass façades of high-rise buildings have been significantly increased in recent years due to the growth of the construction industry. The conventional cleaning methods for high-rise buildings require human labor where efficiency, cost, and safety are major concerns. Therefore, robotic systems that can climb and clean glass fagades in high-rise buildings have been developed. Capability to attach to a façade surface is one of the critical requirements of a glass façade cleaning robot. Diverse approaches have been proposed for adhesion of cleaning robots to a glass façade. Active vacuum suction mechanisms are widely used for these robots since they provide better controllability to move the robots smartly on the surface. Notably, those are decent for a reconfigurable robot that can transit between window frames. The suction mechanism of a glass façade cleaning robot must provide a reliable suction force to make the robot stay safely and move smartly on a façade. Nevertheless, these suction mechanisms can be failed due to improper fastening between a façade and the mechanism, which may lead to safety and operational issues. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel method to realize the adhesion-awareness of a glass façade cleaning robot. The adhesion-awareness is realized by analyzing The current drawn by the motors attached to the impellers of the vacuum mechanisms. Experiment results validate the capability of the proposed approach in raising the adhesion-awareness of a façade cleaning robot. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - Study Objectives: Polysomnography (PSG) scoring is labor intensive and suffers from variability in inter- and intra-rater reliability. Automated PSG scoring has the potential to reduce the human labor costs and the variability inherent to this task. Deep learning is a form of machine learning that uses neural networks to recognize data patterns by inspecting many examples rather than by following explicit programming. Methods: A sleep staging classifier trained using deep learning methods scored PSG data from the Sleep Heart Health Study (SHHS). The training set was composed of 42 560 hours of PSG data from 5213 patients. To capture higher-order data, spectrograms were generated from electroencephalography, electrooculography, and electromyography data and then passed to the neural network. A holdout set of 580 PSGs not included in the training set was used to assess model accuracy and discrimination via weighted F1-score, per-stage accuracy, and Cohen's kappa (K). Results: The optimal neural network model was composed of spectrograms in the input layer feeding into convolutional neural network layers and a long short-term memory layer to achieve a weighted F1-score of 0.87 and K = 0.82. Conclusions: The deep learning sleep stage classifier demonstrates excellent accuracy and agreement with expert sleep stage scoring, outperforming human agreement on sleep staging. It achieves comparable or better F1-scores, accuracy, and Cohen's kappa compared to literature for automated sleep stage scoring of PSG epochs. Accurate automated scoring of other PSG events may eventually allow for fully automated PSG scoring. © 2019 Sleep Research Society.

AB  - Labor shortage is one of the most common yet critical problems in industrial sectors. Using robotics and automation to replace human labor is one of the most effective solutions. In this research, robotic technology is implemented in the trimming process which is one of the key steps in faucet manufacturing. The system is designed to be able to deal with uncertainties of the shape of flash that are occurred due to the impression-die forging process. A gripper with specific jaws is designed to suit the workpiece. A vision system is used to identify the position and orientation of the workpieces. As a result, with the gripper and the vision system, the workpieces can be grasped, transferred, and loaded into the trimming machine at high success rate in comparison to human labor. In this paper, the design procedure of the gripper and performance of the gripper are emphasized. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Industry 4.0, which is aimed at the global introduction of cyber-physical systems into industry, has determined further development pathways for cluster systems; one of the pathways is digitalization of business processes, which enables cutting costs significantly, manufacturing a high-tech innovative product, reducing time for communication between all the participants in the industrial cluster, revealing new sources for project funding, simplifying human work via relevant software and robotics adopted in the industry. All these factors become more urgent in the framework of functioning high-tech industrial clusters, which have not evolved only from the protocluster to the innovative active industrial cluster, but overtook their rivals by using these innovative available tools of the digital economy. In this paper the authors have presented a range of the most applicable methods to measure the digital potential of the industrial cluster (in regard to quantity, quality and mixed research methods); they have reviewed the literature that reveal the concept "innovative potential" of an industry enterprise and a cluster; the authors have considered 13 stages of digital potential measurement for the industrial cluster, including the following: identification of measurement parameters, classification of parameters by 6 subpotentials, expert evaluation of parameters, tabulation of the obtained expert survey results, selection of most significant parameters, final preparation of groups of factors, determination of a scale and units of measure for every selected factor to evaluate, collection of information from accessible sources, reduction of the received data to a unified measurement system, calculation of an integral index based on the developed scales, final stage includes guideline development. On the basis of the presented stages the authors worked out a relevant measurement algorithm, novelty and peculiarity of which imply allowance for indicators that characterize cluster digitalization (i.e. digital potential) when calculating a final integral value. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to determine the priorities of formation of competencies during training of digital personnel for industry 4.0. Design/methodology/approach: The author performs two experiments for determining the scenario according to which industry 4.0 develops and will develop: the first experiment is aimed at determining the influence of the number of robots at unemployment level in 2019 and 2022 with the help of regression and correlation analysis (regression curves are built). The second experiment is connected to evaluation of the ratio of the number of robots to the number of population in 2019 and 2022. The research objects are countries with the highest number of robots in the world – i.e. with the highest level of development of industry 4.0; the information and empirical basis is materials of the International Federation of Robotics and the International Monetary Fund for 2019 and their forecasts for 2022. Findings: The results of the performed experiments showed that in 2019 and 2022 the level of robotization of socio-economic systems of the countries of the world will be very low, and robotization will not cause growth of unemployment. Based on this, it is concluded that industry 4.0 will be developing according to the scenario of moderate automatization and robotization with preservation of domination of human labor in most business processes and spheres of economy. Communications with people will constitute the basis of the activities of digital personnel, and social competencies (with obvious significance of technical competencies) will be of top priority for them. Originality/value: It is substantiated that technical competencies, with their large importance, will move to the background, while the key task will be society’s adaptation to the new technological mode and making social competencies the highest priority. The social and technical competencies of digital personnel in view of the performed tasks for industry 4.0 are determined. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Automatic object recognition is the main key to the auto robot system. As like the eye in humans, object recognition is a system of identification on a computer. With this capability, object recognition can be developed to help facilitate human work from monotonous and repetitive work. In the field of medical, object recognition can be combined with an operating robot to free the nurse's duties from the work of sending and retrieving surgical instruments during the operation process. One of the simplest recognition methods is using the K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) algorithm, by finding the closest distance between the object and the dataset. Opencv is added as an additional library that aims to facilitate the pre-processing of image. This paper implements the KNN algorithm to distinguish the surgical instrument with a relation test set to train set is 1:1. The pre-processing section has been done with Opencv which is used to separate interest objects with a background. The classifier parameters that used are aspect ratio, solidity, and contour ratio. A region of interest (ROI) is required to limit the object area to be processed. It helps to find the principal axis to rotate the image. The aim is to extract the important information as a new orthogonal variable called main components. The KNN method test results show the robustness of automatic intraoperative object detection that can be used to improve the specialist's preventive state acknowledgment amid the robot-helped medical procedure. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - This paper a study of a vehicle that goes over small objects by indoor. Recently, the robot industry market has spread. Among them, many companies advancing the introduction and utilization of service robots purpose to the substitution of human work. Consequently, only 60% answered that they were achieved results. The reason for the low results is that conventional robots do not have enough size, traveling performance and positioning accuracy. In this study, after examining the robot implementation and the conventional robot, we aim at the one that functions sufficiently the size, traveling performance and omnidirectional movement within the indoor environment. To this end, we propose a vehicle that can move in omnidirectional and can move each foot independently in the vertical direction. In the experiment of this study, a distance sensor was attached to the foot to detect the front floor height. When the floor height fluctuated, it was considered that there were small objects, and the foot was raised according to the height of them, and they were gone over. As a result, the sensor could detect small objects and realize the going over action. In the future, we aim to realize autonomous driving by combining it with the technology of omnidirectional movement. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - Advances in robotics and artificial intelligence are increasingly enabling organizations to replace humans with intelligent machines and algorithms1. Forecasts predict that, in the coming years, these new technologies will affect millions of workers in a wide range of occupations, replacing human workers in numerous tasks2,3, but potentially also in whole occupations1,4,5. Despite the intense debate about these developments in economics, sociology and other social sciences, research has not examined how people react to the technological replacement of human labour. We begin to address this gap by examining the psychology of technological replacement. Our investigation reveals that people tend to prefer workers to be replaced by other human workers (versus robots); however, paradoxically, this preference reverses when people consider the prospect of their own job loss. We further demonstrate that this preference reversal occurs because being replaced by machines, robots or software (versus other humans) is associated with reduced self-threat. In contrast, being replaced by robots is associated with a greater perceived threat to one’s economic future. These findings suggest that technological replacement of human labour has unique psychological consequences that should be taken into account by policy measures (for example, appropriately tailoring support programmes for the unemployed). © 2019, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.

AB  - Surveys for assessing the condition of sewer pipeline systems are mainly based on video surveillance or CCTV, which is a time-consuming process that relies heavily on human labor because an operator has to watch videos, looks for defects and decides the defect's type manually. Previous research required suitable handcrafted features that were inefficient in analyzing sewer pipeline condition, so a robust and efficient framework is crucial as it eliminates the time-consuming tasks and helps the operator access condition of sewer systems more efficiently. This study proposes a defect classification system on CCTV inspection videos based on convolutional neural networks (CNN). The dataset was manually constructed and validated by extracting the images from CCTV videos, and the images were labeled according to six predefined defects. The CNN model was fine-tuned before training, and trained on a total of 47,072 images (256 × 256 pixels). The highest recorded accuracy was at 96.33%. As a result, the presented framework will motivate the finding of a more robust model that automatically and precisely evaluates the condition of sewer pipeline systems using CCTV and encourages the integration of the proposed model in real applications. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Urban villages emerge with the rapid urbanization process in many developing countries, and bring serious social and economic challenges to urban authorities, such as overcrowding and low living standards. A comprehensive understanding of the locations and regional boundaries of urban villages in a city is crucial for urban planning and management, especially when urban authorities need to renovate these regions. Traditional methods greatly rely on surveys and investigations of city planners, which consumes substantial time and human labor. In this work, we propose a low-cost and automatic framework to accurately identify urban villages from high-resolution remote sensing satellite imagery. Specifically, we leverage the Mask Regional Convolutional Neural Network (Mask-RCNN) model for end-to-end urban village detection and segmentation. We evaluate our framework on the city-wide satellite imagery of Xiamen, China. Results show that our framework successfully detects 87.18% of the urban villages in the city, and accurately segments their regional boundaries with an IoU of 74.48%. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.

AB  - Culture is core to human civilization. It evolved over time. Culture is about human intellectual achievements in social context. It is about how humans work together, perform particular task and overall lifestyle and dealing with other groups of civilization. Thus, it is concerned with establishing ideas. Does culture play key role in success? Does it impact on how two individuals can work together in achieving certain goals? Are some key questions. In this paper, we establish a means to derive cultural association and map it to culturally mediated success. Human interactions with the environment are typically in the form of expressions. Association between culture and behavior produce similar beliefs which lead to common principles and actions, while cultural similarity as a set of common expressions and responses. To measure cultural association among different candidates, we propose the use of a Graphical Association Method (GAM). The behaviors of candidates are captured through series of expressions and represented in the graphical form. Association among corresponding node and core nodes is used for the same. The proposed approach gives promising and interesting results. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - Thermal diagnosis based on infrared photos taken by robots is a low-cost measure with promising results in the defect detection of power apparatus. To reduce the work of human investigation on those photos, this paper provides an automatic program by means of image segmentation and template recognition. First, the original RGB (Red, Green, Blue) color of the pixels in thermal images are transformed into the Lab (Luminosity, color vectors a b) space. Then, we carry out K-means clustering in Lab space, divide the image into K classes, remove the class that represents the background value of the image, and get the image without background. Later, NCC (Normalized Cross Correlation) grayscale matching algorithm is used to find out the location of the device. Finally, the processed images are clustered again by K-means, and the results are divided into different layers, and the variances of L, a, b in Lab are calculated. Fault diagnosis is done by comparing the variance of different levels. The example shows that when the original image is divided into 4 layers, the background can be removed well, and when the number of layers is increased, the corresponding variance of the corresponding variance is significantly reduced to show that the equipment has overheating fault. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - With the growth in applications of Artificial Intelligence day by day, every domain is going automated. Machine learning has enabled systems to learn the process on its own in order to reduce the human labour. In sports like cricket, Football AI has not been used on a greater scale but there are certain areas where it can be of great help to apply AI techniques. In this paper the outcome classification task has been performed on cricket videos. The main purpose of performing such activities is to create automatic commentary generation. There are many sub-tasks needed to be considered for this task. One of those tasks is to classify the outcome of each ball for which commentary is to be generated. There has not been any standard data to perform such task, neither are any benchmark results to compare a new one. So in this paper, from data collection to performing the classification operation with results has been produced. There are four most general outcomes in the game of cricket such as Run, Dot, Boundary, Wicket. With the help of Convolutional Neural Network and Long Short-Term Memory Networks the outcome of cricket match ball by ball videos has been classified with 70% of test accuracy. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - Modernization of living environments and human activities have severe effects on many parameters and factors such as climate change and global warming, an increase of incidence and the severity of wildfires, land surfaces and ice sheets, ecological imbalance, change of fertility of the soil, flow of energy, food security, etc. In addition, human modernization has had a negative impact on biodiversity and the natural environment. An integral component of modernization is agriculture that associates with the outdoor environment and relevant issues. Automation of agricultural activities contributes to reducing the dependency on human labor and the harmful effects on the natural environment. The correct identification of plants in outdoor environments has been neglected and many critical environmental and non-environmental limits and factors, such as weather conditions, time, viewpoint, lighting conditions (illuminations and light intensity), distance, etc., have not been considered in existing plant recognition systems and technologies. Hence, there is a demand to develop mobile and real-time systems for plant recognition in natural environments. This paper addresses these challenges and introduces the application of autonomous mobile robot and semi-robots for recognition of natural plant species in outdoor environments. Furthermore, the proposed system presents the use of employing low-cost cameras, such as iPhone 6s, Canon EOS 600D and Samsung Galaxy Note 4, for plant recognition system in real-time. The performance of the system has been tested with a number of experiments in different years, 2017 and 2018, and at different times of day, morning and evening. The proposed system is a combination of new technologies involving deep learning concepts and an autonomous field robot to carry out precise plant recognition in challenging environments. The final accuracy of the mobile real-time system is 84.1666%. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - The ubiquitous use of industrial technology 4.0 is increasing mainly to facilitate human work. This is because ubiquitous is a small and inexpensive device but has limitations in resources. Research on ubiquitous continues to be developed especially in the use of sensors in ubiquitous. Optimization of face sensors for face detection has also been done. High computing for face detection optimization causes overload on ubiquitous and low accuracy of face detection. This is because resources are limited to ubiquitous. This study developed the human face emotional detection using Computational Intelligence in ubiquitous devices. The computations carried out on ubiquitous devices to detect facial emotions using the K-Means algorithm to segment colors in the results of face images. Photos of segmentation were carried out by histogram to get the gray value. Then, the value is matched with the dataset in the database. The dataset has been classified based on 3 face emotional conditions which are happy, normal, and sad. The dataset classification uses the Nearest Neighbors algorithm. Results of the system testing are done by dataset testing and direct testing on the application. The test results were lined up with an average accuracy of 77.5% with an error of 22.5%. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - The authors investigated the effect of gaze tracking of humans by an agent. Psychological studies have shown that the presence of others facilitates task with implying partnership. This effect also occurs if the presence of others is replaced with a robot. Furthermore, the previous research showed that being touched by a robot motivates a person. However, direct contact such as the touch of a robot has a risk of disturbing human work. The authors used gaze tracking for social facilitation because gaze tracking can also facilitate human efforts and implemented a social facilitation robot agent by using gaze tracking. The agent projects its face on a surface to show quickly changing expressions, which is difficult to achieve with ordinary robots. The agent can also express gaze tracking by implementing eye trackers. The authors prepared three conditions with monotonous tasks to compare the effects of gaze tracking: The agent gazes at the instructed point moves its gaze randomly and traces the gaze point of a participant. The results showed that the participants' motivation increased if the agent is tracking gazed point by a human, even though there are no differences between the achievement scores of the task and the continuation time. © 2019 Institution of Engineering and Technology.

AB  - Fake news and rumors constitute a major problem in social networks recently. Due to the fast information propagation in social networks, it is inefficient to use human labor to detect suspicious news. Automatic rumor detection is thus necessary to prevent devastating effects of rumors on the individuals and society. Previous work has shown that in addition to the content of the news/posts and their contexts (i.e., replies), the relations or connections among those components are important to boost the rumor detection performance. In order to induce such relations between posts and contexts, the prior work has mainly relied on the inherent structures of the social networks (e.g., direct replies), ignoring the potential semantic connections between those objects. In this work, we demonstrate that such semantic relations are also helpful as they can reveal the implicit structures to better capture the patterns in the contexts for rumor detection. We propose to employ the self-attention mechanism in neural text modeling to achieve the semantic structure induction for this problem. In addition, we introduce a novel method to preserve the important information of the main news/posts in the final representations of the entire threads to further improve the performance for rumor detection. Our method matches the main post representations and the thread representations by ensuring that they predict the same latent labels in a multitask learning framework. The extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model for rumor detection, yielding the state-of-the-art performance on recent datasets for this problem. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.

AB  - Knowing individual real attributes is beneficial to intelligent marking, automatic advertising as well as a new application of smart home system. In this paper, we leverage seemingly innocent user information (step count) coming from ubiquitous mobile and sensing device for attribute inference. The utilization of sensor data breaks the traditional dependence on text, social relationship and online behavior in social media, and avoids the problem of users' gender variation in linguistic style on different social networks. Existing methods on attribute inference usually ignore the temporal information of data and purely explore different types of features manually. However, loss of temporal characteristic may reduce the representation ability to infer user's attributes. Meanwhile, excessively depending on manually defined features requires a great mass of human labor and often suffers from under specification. To address these problems, we propose a novel Hybrid Multiple Representations (HMR) model that combines simple human knowledge with automated deep learning by using stacked bidirectional LSTM, Bag-of-step and Holiday Activation methods to predict gender and age from users daily step count. Experiments are conducted on a real-world pedometer dataset where gender and age are to be predicted. The empirical results show that our HMR model does a good job on the task of predicting attributes compared with state-of-the-art baselines. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - Deep learning-based pattern recognition has achieved impressive accuracy recently. In particular, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been successfully applied to solving various practical problems. One such problem is image-based product defect inspection. Product quality inspection is an essential step in a production line. So far, this task has been conducted primarily by human inspectors, but the inspection results are often affected by various human factors such as experience, health conditions, attention, and so on. CNN can be useful for reducing human factors and thus can be good for quality control. In practice, however, CNN-based defect detection is still a challenging task. One reason is that a single false negative (FN) error (i.e., classifying a defect as a normal case) may be a liability for a company, and this is the crucial difference between image recognition and defect detection. To reduce the FN error rate, in this study, we investigate the effect of 'rejection' for defect detection. Experimental results demonstrate that a CNN ensemble with a proper rejection rate can have a very low FN error rate and can reduce human labor significantly. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - Sewer pipes are commonly inspected in situ with CCTV equipment. The CCTV footage is then reviewed by human operators in order to classify defects in the pipes and make a recommendation on possible interventions. This process is both labor-intensive and error-prone. Other researchers have suggested machine learning techniques to (partially) automate the human review of this footage, but the automated classifiers are often validated in artificial testing setups, leading to biased results that do not translate directly to operational impact. In this work, we discuss suitable evaluation metrics for this specific classification task — most notably ‘specificity at sensitivity’ and ‘precision at recall’ — and the importance of using a validation setup that includes a realistic ratio of images with defects to images without defects, and a sufficiently large dataset. We also introduce ‘leave-two-inspections-out’ cross validation, designed to eliminate a data leakage bias that would otherwise cause an overestimation of classifier performance. We designed a convolutional neural network (CNN) and applied this validation methodology to automatically detect the twelve most common defect types in a dataset of over 2 million CCTV images. With this dataset and our validation methodology, our CNN outperforms the state-of-the-art. Classification performance was highest for intruding and defective connections and lowest for porous pipes. While the CNN is not capable of fully automated classification at sufficient performance levels, we determined that if we augment the human operator with the CNN, this may reduce the required human labor by up to 60.5%. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Fault diagnosis of rotating machinery is crucial to improve safety, enhance reliability and reduce maintenance cost. The manual feature extraction and selection of traditional fault diagnosis methods depend on signal processing skills and expert experience, which is labor-intensive and time-consuming. As a typical intelligent fault diagnosis method, the convolutional neural network automatically learns features from original data, but it is extremely difficult to design and train a deep network architecture. This paper proposes a fault diagnosis scheme combined of hierarchical symbolic analysis (HSA) and convolutional neural network (CNN), which achieves laborsaving and timesaving preliminary feature extraction and accomplishes automatically feature learning with simplified network architecture. Firstly, hierarchical symbolic analysis is employed to extract features from original signals. The extracted features are able to identify different health conditions under various operating conditions. Then, convolutional neural network instead of human labor is used to learn the complex non-linear relationship between features and health conditions automatically. The architecture of CNN diagnosis model is simple and convenient to implement. Finally, a centrifugal pump dataset and a motor bearing dataset are adopted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The diagnosis results show that the proposed method exhibits superior performance compared with shallow methods and deep learning methods. © 2019 ISA

AB  - Purpose: In the most abstract way, artificial intelligence (AI) allows human work to be shifted toward technological systems that are currently not fully capable. Following this, the domain of retail can be sketched as a natural fit for the application of AI tools, which are known for their high proportion of human work and concurrent low profit margins. This paper aims to explore the current dissemination of the application of AI within the industry. The value-added core tasks of retail companies are examined to determine the possible utilization and the market adoption within the globally largest retail companies is given. Design/methodology/approach: The paper uses two different approaches to identify the scientific state-of-the-art: a search on the major scientific databases and an empirical study of the ten largest international retail companies and their adoption of AI technologies in the domains of wholesale and retail. Findings: The application within the different value-added core tasks varies greatly depending on the area. In summary, there are numerous possible applications in all areas. Especially, in areas where future forecasts are needed within the task areas (such as marketing or replenishment), the use of AI, today, is both scientifically and practically highly developed. In contrast, the market adoption of AI is highly variable. The pioneers have integrated extensive applications into everyday business, while the challengers are investing heavily in new initiatives. Some others, however, show neither active use nor any effort to adopt such technology. Originality/value: To the best of the author’s knowledge, this is one of the first research contributions to analyze the areas of application and the impact of AI structured along the value-added core processes of retail companies. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - The land-use map is an important data that can reflect the use and transformation of human land, and can provide valuable reference for land-use planning. For the traditional image classification method, producing a high spatial resolution (HSR), land-use map in large-scale is a big project that requires a lot of human labor, time, and financial expenditure. The rise of the deep learning technique provides a new solution to the problems above. This paper proposes a fast and precise method that can achieve large-scale land-use classification based on deep convolutional neural network (DCNN). In this paper, we optimize the data tiling method and the structure of DCNN for the multi-channel data and the splicing edge effect, which are unique to remote sensing deep learning, and improve the accuracy of land-use classification. We apply our improved methods in the Guangdong Province of China using GF-1 images, and achieve the land-use classification accuracy of 81.52%. It takes only 13 hours to complete the work, which will take several months for human labor. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - Underwater vehicle manipulator system (UVMS) generally consists of a camera unit and robotic manipulator. Its main function is to replace human work in underwater manipulation tasks. Most commercially available manipulators are not designed for autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) because the vehicle does not have sufficient power supply to drive these manipulators which are electro-hydraulically driven. A proposed solution is to invest in development of low power underwater manipulator to deepen studies in AUV. Thus, this research has an objective of developing an underwater manipulator for small scale AUV. In this research, the manipulator is used in an object recovery task. An acrylic scissor arm which is electro-mechanically driven is used as manipulator in this research. Permanent magnets are used as its end effector. A Pixy CMUcam5 vision sensor is paired with this manipulator to navigate the AUV and control the manipulator. The usage of planar pressure housing helps in reducing light refraction effect of underwater environment that may affect the sensor’s accuracy. From the simulation done using Solid Works, it is found out that type 316L stainless steel is the best choice for the manipulator developed. To evaluate the performance of the UVMS developed, a series of tests are carried out. Based on the results obtained, it is known that the system has high speed and consistency with minimum time delay between input and output. As long as an object has distinct colour signature from its background and its surrounding is clear and well illuminated, the Pixy vision sensor can detect that object regardless of the distance between the sensor and the object. © 2019, University of Minnesota Press.

AB  - Semantic 3D models have shown their importance in many fields such as autonomous driving. However, it remains a tough task to assign semantic labels to various scenes. In this paper, we propose an Active Learning based method for semantic labeling of street view point clouds with a small amount of annotated data samples. The proposed method takes a point cloud and registrated images as the input, and yields a point cloud with semantic labels. We iteratively fine-tunes a network with the ever-enlarging training set to exploit the semantic information of the scene, and fuse the semantic labels in 3D space. To deal with the imbalanced data in street view scenes, a label biased criterion for query selection is proposed to help select images to efficiently improve the performance of the network and the quality of the semantic model. Experimental result shows that the proposed method demands limited human labor and works well in assigning semantic labels to the imbalanced scenes like street view scenes. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - Based on recent developments in the field of artificial intelligence (AI), we examine what type of human labor will be a substitute versus a complement to emerging technologies. We argue that these recent developments reduce the costs of providing a particular set of tasks – prediction tasks. Prediction about uncertain states of the world is an input into decision-making. We show that prediction allows riskier decisions to be taken and this is its impact on observed productivity although it could also increase the variance of outcomes as well. We consider the role of human judgment in decision-making as prediction technology improves. Judgment is exercised when the objective function for a particular set of decisions cannot be described (i.e., coded). However, we demonstrate that better prediction impacts the returns to different types of judgment in opposite ways. Hence, not all human judgment will be a complement to AI. Finally, we show that humans will delegate some decisions to machines even when the decision would be superior with human input. © 2019

AB  - This paper presents the development and experimental testing of the effectiveness of a robotic cleaning system for fish processing plants. The processing of fish introduces a substantial risk of bacterial contamination, which can cause the spoilage of fish and pose a threat to consumers’ health. Good operational hygiene and precautions, in addition to regular cleaning of the processing plants, are necessary for the reduction of the risk of contamination. The state-of-the art cleaning techniques currently include manual cleaning operations of fish processing plants. The experiments of robotic cleaning presented in this paper were performed in two rounds. First, a test using a conventional low-cost industrial robot mounted on a vertical linear axis was used. As the results from this test seemed promising, a second robotic system was built aiming at a more industrialized version. This system consisted of a serial manipulator, tailored for the task, mounted on a horizontal transportation system, and a comparison was conducted between the cleaning performed by human operators and that performed by the robotic system. An electrical stunner with a connected conveyor belt, which is a typical installation for salmon processing plants, was experimentally inoculated with a cocktail of fish-spoilage bacteria that were allowed to develop a biofilm. Back-to-back cleaning trials with biofilms of Pseudomonas fluorescens, Pseudomonas putida, and Photobacterium phosphoreum confirmed that the industrialized robotic prototype performed equally well or better than the conventional manual cleaning procedure currently used in the industry. The results demonstrate that a robotic system can deliver satisfactory results in the cleaning of fish processing plants, thereby minimizing the potential for the spread of contamination. The proposed robotic concept allows for an automated cleaning system, reduced human labor, increased profitability for the industry, and better stability of the cleaning process. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Accurate pose estimation is often a requirement for robust robotic grasping and manipulation of objects placed in cluttered, tight environments, such as a shelf with multiple objects. When deep learning approaches are employed to perform this task, they typically require a large amount of training data. However, obtaining precise 6 degrees of freedom for ground-truth can be prohibitively expensive. This work therefore proposes an architecture and a training process to solve this issue. More precisely, we present a weak object detector that enables localizing objects and estimating their 6D poses in cluttered and occluded scenes. To minimize the human labor required for annotations, the proposed detector is trained with a combination of synthetic and a few weakly annotated real images (as little as 10 images per object), for which a human provides only a list of objects present in each image (no time-consuming annotations, such as bounding boxes, segmentation masks and object poses). To close the gap between real and synthetic images, we use multiple domain classifiers trained adversarially. During the inference phase, the resulting class-specific heatmaps of the weak detector are used to guide the search of 6D poses of objects. Our proposed approach is evaluated on several publicly available datasets for pose estimation. We also evaluated our model on classification and localization in unsupervised and semi-supervised settings. The results clearly indicate that this approach could provide an efficient way toward fully automating the training process of computer vision models used in robotics. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - The massive spread of negative contents on the internet has become a national problem in Indonesia. Website is one of the media which is used to spread the negative contents. This research aims to classify the negative contents into several categories such as gambling, pornography, and fraud based on existing resources from TRUST+™ Positif database. The classification is done by utilizing the keywords from URLs and the entire contents of the website. The research will also generate a collection of the lexicon in unigram and bigram of Bahasa Indonesia which characterizes gambling, pornography, and fraud category. Therefore, the classification process can be completed faster and also will reduce the dependency on human labors. The methodology of this research consists of web crawling, web scraping, feature extraction, training, testing, and data validation. Among three classification algorithms (Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbor, and Support Vector Machine) which are experimented in this research, the results show that the Support Vector Machine (SVM) model has the highest level of accuracy (95.3886%). The data validation is done by trying out 20 new URLs that are not part of the training dataset. Among those URLs, there are 17 or 85% URLs that display the correct results. According to the experiments, the system has made many mistakes in gambling and fraud content prediction. Because those categories have similar characteristics in words representations. Based on the result, this research concludes that there is a number of improvements that can be conducted to improve the negative content identification. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - On-machine monitoring of tool wear in machining processes has found its importance to reduce equipment downtime and reduce tooling costs. As the tool wears out gradually, the contact state of the cutting edge and the workpiece changes, which has a significant influence on the vibration state of the spindle. The performance of traditional intelligent fault diagnosis methods depend on feature extraction of dynamic signals, which requires expert knowledge and human labor. Recently, deep learning algorithms have been applied widely in machine health monitoring. In this paper, we present a novel intelligent technique for tool wear state recognition using machine spindle vibration signals. The proposed technique combines derived wavelet frames (DWFs) and convolutional neural network (CNN). Constructed based on dual tree wavelets, DWF are equipped with merits of centralized multiresolution and nearly translation-invariance. In this method, DWFs are employed to decompose the original signal into frequency bands of different bandwidths and different center frequencies, which are more pronounced as the tool wears. Further, the reconstructed sub-signals are stacked into a 2-D signal matrix to match the structure of 2-D CNN while retaining more dynamic information. The 2-D convolutional neural network is utilized to automatically recognize features from the multiscale 2-D signal matrix. End-milling experiments were performed on a S45C steel workpiece at different machining parameters. The experiment results of the recognition for tool wear state show the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2018

AB  - Collaborative robots are widely employed in strict hybrid assembly tasks involved in intelligent manufacturing. In this paper, we develop a teaching-learning-collaboration (TLC) model for the collaborative robot to learn from human demonstrations and assist its human partner in shared working situations. The human could program the robot using natural language instructions according to his/her personal working preferences via this approach. Afterward, the robot learns from human assembly demonstrations by taking advantage of the maximum entropy inverse reinforcement learning algorithm and updates its task-based knowledge using the optimal assembly strategy. In the collaboration process, the robot is able to leverage its learned knowledge to actively assist the human in the collaborative assembly task. Experimental results and analysis demonstrate that the proposed approach presents considerable robustness and applicability in human-robot collaborative tasks. Note to Practitioners - This paper is motivated by the human-robot collaborative assembly problem in the context of advanced manufacturing. Collaborative robotics makes a huge shift from the traditional robot-in-a-cage model to robots interacting with people in an open working environment. When the human works with the robot in the shared workspace, it is significant to lessen human programming effort and improve the human-robot collaboration efficiency once the task is updated. We develop a TLC model for the robot to learn from human demonstrations and assist its human partner in collaborative tasks. Once the task is changed, the human may code the robot via natural language instructions according to his/her personal working preferences. The robot can learn from human assembly demonstrations to update its task-based knowledge, which can be leveraged by the robot to actively assist the human to accomplish the collaborative task. We demonstrate the advantages of the proposed approach via a set of experiments in realistic human-robot collaboration contexts. © 2004-2012 IEEE.

AB  - This paper examines the effects of labor-replacing capital, referred to as robots, on business cycle dynamics using a New Keynesian model with a role for both traditional and robot capital. This study finds that shocks to the price of robots have effects on wages, output, and employment that are distinct from shocks to the price of traditional capital. Further, the inclusion of robots alters the response of employment and labor’s share to total factor productivity and monetary policy shocks. The presence of robots also weakens the correlation between human labor and output and the correlation between human labor and labor’s share. The paper finds that monetary policymakers would need to place a greater emphasis on output stabilization if their objective is to minimize a weighted average of output and inflation volatility. Moreover, if policymakers have an employment stabilization objective apart from their output stabilization objective, they would have to further focus on output stabilization due to the deterioration of the output-employment correlation. © 2019, International Atlantic Economic Society.

AB  - Solar energy is now a leading source of renewable energy that can replace fossil fuels. There are many solar farms in the world because it is eco-friendly and can generate electricity semi-permanently. However, these farms are costly with maintenance issues which require high-cost detection. Among various methods for detection, this paper adopts the method of thermal imaging with a UAV to detect defects efficiently. Especially, the power generation efficiency varies significantly depending on the installed angle of the solar panel. For this reason, it is important to consider the angle when the solar panel is installed. This work designs a system analyzing the range of angle between a solar panel and thermal camera to detect defective cells of the solar panel effectively. We developed an algorithm which detects defective solar cells using computer vision and captured out the meaningful outcome by analyzing the result of the experiment. The use of UAV and the thermal camera can reduce the cost and improve the efficiency of maintenance by minimizing human labor. In the future, our algorithm can be automated and scaled to apply to solar farms worldwide. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - Information technologies in general and artifical intelligence (AI) in particular try to shift operational task away from a human actor. Machine learning (ML) is a discipline within AI that deals with learning improvement based on data. Subsequently, retailing and wholesaling, which are known for their high proportion of human work and at the same time low profit margins, can be regarded as a natural fit for the application of AI and ML tools. This article examines the current prevalence of the use of machine learning in the industry. The paper uses two disparate approaches to identify the scientific and practical state-of-the-art within the domain: a literature review on the major scientific databases and an empirical study of the 10 largest international retail companies and their adoption of ML technologies in the domain are combined with each other. This text does not present a prototype using machine learning techniques. Instead of a consideration and comparison of the particular algorythms and approaches, the underling problems and operational tasks that are elementary for the specific domain are identified. Based on a comprehensive literature review the main problem types that ML can serve, and the associated ML techniques, are evaluated. An empirical study of the 10 largest retail companies and their ML adoption shows that the practical market adoption is highly variable. The pioneers have extensively integrated applications into everyday business, while others only show a small set of early prototypes. However, some others show neither active use nor efforts to apply such a technology. Following this, a structured approach is taken to analyze the value-adding core processes of retail companies. The current scientific and practical application scenarios and possibilities are illustrated in detail. In summary, there are numerous possible applications in all areas. In particular, in areas where future forecasts and predictions are needed (like marketing or replenishment), the use of ML today is both scientifically and practically highly developed. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Much contemporary rhetoric regards the prospects and pitfalls of using artificial intelligence techniques to automate an increasing range of tasks, especially those once considered the purview of people alone. These accounts are often wildly optimistic, understating outstanding challenges while turning a blind eye to the human labor that undergirds and sustains ostensibly “automated” services. This long-standing focus on purely automated methods unnecessarily cedes a promising design space: one in which computational assistance augments and enriches, rather than replaces, people's intellectual work. This tension between human agency and machine automation poses vital challenges for design and engineering. In this work, we consider the design of systems that enable rich, adaptive interaction between people and algorithms. We seek to balance the often-complementary strengths and weaknesses of each, while promoting human control and skillful action. We share case studies of interactive systems we have developed in three arenas-data wrangling, exploratory analysis, and natural language translation-that integrate proactive computational support into interactive systems. To improve outcomes and support learning by both people and machines, we describe the use of shared representations of tasks augmented with predictive models of human capabilities and actions. We conclude with a discussion of future prospects and scientific frontiers for intelligence augmentation research. © 2019 National Academy of Sciences. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a powerful, widespread and indispensable medical imaging modality. The American College of Radiology (ACR) recommends weekly acquisition of phantom images to assess the quality of scanner. Usually, these images must be analyzed by experienced technicians. Automatic analysis of these images would reduce costs and improve repeatability. Some automated methods have been proposed, but the automation of two of the ACR image quality tests remains open problem. Reports on the high- and low-contrast resolution tests are scarce and so far none of the proposed methods produce results robust enough to allow replacing human work. We use Machine Learning to emulate, with high accuracy, the detection of 120 low-contrast structures of ACR phantom by an experienced professional. We used a database with 620 sets of ACR phantom images that were acquired on scanners of different vendors, fields and coils, totaling 74,400 low-contrast structures. Technicians with more than 10 years of experience labeled each structure as 'detectable' or 'undetectable'. Machine learning algorithms were fed with image features extracted from the structures and their surroundings. Among the five methods we tested, Logistic Regression yielded the largest area under the ROC curve (0.878) and the highest Krippendorff(s alpha (0.995). The results achieved in this study are substantially better than those previously reported in the literature. They are also better than the classifications made by junior technicians (with less than 5 years of experience). This indicate that the ACR MRI low-contrast resolution test may be automated using Machine Learning. © 2018 IEEE.

AB  - Cardiovascular disease has been the leading cause of death worldwide. Electrocardiogram (ECG)-based heart disease diagnosis is simple, fast, cost effective and non-invasive. However, interpreting ECG waveforms can be taxing for a clinician who has to deal with hundreds of patients during a day. We propose computing machinery to reduce the workload of clinicians and to streamline the clinical work processes. Replacing human labor with machine work can lead to cost savings. Furthermore, it is possible to improve the diagnosis quality by reducing inter- and intra-observer variability. To support that claim, we created a computer program that recognizes normal, Dilated Cardiomyopathy (DCM), Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM) or Myocardial Infarction (MI) ECG signals. The computer program combined Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) based feature extraction and K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN) classification for discriminating the signal classes. The system was verified with tenfold cross validation based on labeled data from the PTB diagnostic ECG database. During the validation, we adjusted the number of neighbors k for the machine learning algorithm. For k=3, training set has an accuracy and cross validation of 98.33% and 95%, respectively. However, when k=5, it showed constant for training set but dropped drastically to 80% for cross-validation. Hence, training set k=5 prevails. Furthermore, a confusion matrix proved that normal data was identified with 96.7% accuracy, 99.6% sensitivity and 99.4% specificity. This means an error of 3.3% will occur. For every 30 normal signals, the classifier will mislabel only 1 of the them as HCM. With these results, we are confident that the proposed system can improve the speed and accuracy with which normal and diseased subjects are identified. Diseased subjects can be treated earlier which improves their probability of survival. © 2019 World Scientific Publishing Company.

AB  - Deep learning methods are at the forefront of leading state-of-the-art methods in a wide range of machine learning applications. In particular, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) attain topmost performance assuming a sufficiently large number of labeled training examples. Unfortunately, labeled data is artificially curated, and it requires human labor, which consequently makes it expensive and time-consuming. Moreover, there are no guarantees that the obtained labels are noise-free. In fact, the performance of CNNs is influenced by the level of noisy labels in the training dataset. Although the literature lacks attention to train learning methods with noisy labels, few semi-supervised learning methods mitigate this obstacle. In this paper, we propose a new teacher/student deep semi-supervised learning (TS-DSSL) method that employs self-training on noisy labels training dataset. We measure the efficiency of TS-DSSL on semi-supervised visual object classification tasks on the benchmark datasets CIFAR10 and MNIST. TS-DSSL achieves impressive results even in the presence of high-level noisy labels. It also sets a record on datasets with various levels of noisy labels created from the previous datasets with uniform and non-uniform noise distributions. © 2018 IEEE.

AB  - A human's work efficiency can be improved in many situations if performing two different tasks simultaneously is possible. In recent years, various robotic extended bodies and its control interfaces have been proposed for assisting manual work. Most of these interfaces are path control-type operation and have been verified under single-task situations; however, their usability with respect to voluntariness and intuitiveness in a dual-task situation has not been addressed. In this paper, we focus on point instruction-type operation that can be used together with conventional path control-type operation in order to improve the control intuitiveness, and propose a new interface 'face vector' which can point at 3-dimensional target position in non-task-oriented environment. The voluntariness and intuitiveness of proposed modality is discussed by measuring its pointing accuracy and effect on work efficiency in dual-task conditions. The results show that numerical data of pointing accuracy of face vector in single and dual task conditions, and indicates that proposed interface is enough intuitive not to reduce the work efficiency. © 2018 IEEE.

AB  - With the development of deep learning, deep metric learning (DML) has achieved great improvements in face recognition. Specifically, the widely used softmax losses in the training process often bring large intra-class variations, and feature normalization is only exploited in the testing process to compute the pair similarities. To bridge the gap, we impose the intra-class cosine similarity between the features and weight vectors in softmax loss larger than a margin in the training step and extend it from four aspects. First, we explore the effect of a hard sample mining strategy. To alleviate the human labor of adjusting the margin hyper-parameter, a self-Adaptive margin updating strategy is proposed. Then, a normalized version is given to take full advantage of the cosine similarity constraint. Furthermore, we enhance the former constraints to consider the intra-class and inter-class constraints simultaneously in the exponential feature projection space. The extensive experiments on the labeled face in the wild (LFW), youtube faces (YTF), and IARPA Janus benchmark A (IJB-A) datasets demonstrate that the proposed methods outperform the mainstream DML methods and approach the state-of-The-Art performance. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Recent progress in AI and Reinforcement learning has shown great success in solving complex problems with high dimensional state spaces. However, most of these successes have been primarily in simulated environments where failure is of little or no consequence. Most real-world applications, however, require training solutions that are safe to operate as catastrophic failures are inadmissible especially when there is human interaction involved. Currently, Safe RL systems use human oversight during training and exploration in order to make sure the RL agent does not go into a catastrophic state. These methods require a large amount of human labor and it is very difficult to scale up. We present a hybrid method for reducing the human intervention time by combining model-based approaches and training a supervised learner to improve sample efficiency while also ensuring safety. We evaluate these methods on various grid-world environments using both standard and visual representations and show that our approach achieves better performance in terms of sample efficiency, number of catastrophic states reached as well as overall task performance compared to traditional model-free approaches. © 2019, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

AB  - The tenet of artificial intelligence (AI) is to use machines to replace humans in performing tasks while the conviction of intelligence augmentation (IA) is to use machines to assist and enhance humans in performing tasks. This paper argues that the relationship between IT and human labor is more nuanced than what has been conceptualized in literature-IT not only can substitute for human labor (the AI effect) but also can complement it (the IA effect); the exact nature depends on the tasks to be performed and the education levels of the employees. We test these predictions using an industry-level dataset covering 60 US industries from 1998 to 2013. The findings reveal co-existence of the AI and the IA effects during the sample period, and that education plays a critical role for workers to benefit from the massive adoption of IT by the US industries. © Proceedings of the 23rd Pacific Asia Conference on Information Systems: Secure ICT Platform for the 4th Industrial Revolution, PACIS 2019.

AB  - Over the past decade, we have witnessed rapid advancements on both practical and theoretical levels in regard to automated construction as a consequence of increasing sophistication of digital fabrication technologies such as robotics, 3D printing, etc. However, digital fabrication technology is often very limited when it comes to dealing with delicate and complex crafting processes. Although digital fabrication processes have become widely accessible and utilized across industries in recent times, there are still a number of fabrication techniques-which heavily rely on human labour-due to the complex nature of procedures and delicacy of materials. With this in mind, we need to ask ourselves if full automation is truly an ultimate goal, or if we need to (re)consider the role of humans in the architectural construction chain, as automation becomes more prevalent. We propose rethinking the role which human, machine, and computer have in construction-occupying the territory between purely automated, exclusively robotically-driven fabrication and highly crafted processes requiring human labour. This is to propose an alternative to reducing construction to fully automated assembly of simplified/discretized building parts, by appreciating physical properties of materials and nature of crafting processes. The research proposes a design-to-construction workflow pursued and enabled by augmented humans using AR devices. As a result, proposed workflows are tested on three prototypical inhabitable structure, aiming to be applicable to other projects in the near future, and to bridge the gap between purely automated construction processes on one hand, and craft-based, material-driven but labour-intensive processes on the other. © Ubiquity and Autonomy - Paper Proceedings of the 39th Annual Conference of the Association for Computer Aided Design in Architecture, ACADIA 2019.

AB  - A constantly growing competition in world economy results in an increasing demand for solutions enhancing both the effiiency of enterprises and the quality of goods produced. A solution which meets both requirements is robotization of production processes, i. e. replacing human labour with the work of industrial robots on the positions where tasks are monotonous, onerous or dangerous. The paper presents the economic analysis of the use of robots in production processes, as well as its technological conditioning. On the example of robotization of processes in the enterprise producing semi-trailers, the method of calculating the re-turn on investment was presented and an analysis of the labor costs of the worker and the robot at a given workplace was made. © 2019.

AB  - The emerging technologies based on artificial intelligence and robotics are challenging the landscape for human labor. Revolution 4.0 is progressively questioning some business models, changing the balance between creation and destruction of jobs, accelerating the transformation of occupational and skills requirements and affecting the distribution of income, because these technologies can replace both manual and cognitive skills. Our research analyzes how digital revolution is affecting labor market in Spain. We mainly focus on the new employment created since the outbreak of the recent financial crisis. We confirm a skill-biased technological change, although the new occupations are mostly demanding a limited set of complex skills. This is a consequence of the routine task-intensive economic structure in Spain. Although digital technologies are inciting a task-biased technological change, decreasing the demand for workers performing routine tasks, this is not the case in Spain. The predominance of routine (but not repetitive) tasks in many services linked to serving, attending, health and care is limiting the scope of automation. The immediate consequence is a growing polarization in employment opportunities and incomes. In addition, a progressive de-skilling effect is emerging, with high-skilled workers moving down the occupational ladder, whereas the wage premium is declining. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.

AB  - The aim of this research is to compute the forward kinematics and control of a robotic arm, which is using in different industries such as food, polymer, pharmaceuticals and chemistry production. Employers in chemical factories sometimes causing some errors during the packaging process, as well as high production costs and time spent on implementation, therefore, it is better to replace this human work with programmable manipulator robot that can be implemented with development of production quality, and also reduce the cost of these operations from the previous one. In addition, the main advantage of using these manipulators is automating control without losing working time or boredom and quality improvement within chemical industrial lines. This study had done by using a new developed geometrical approach method to compute forward kinematics problems with a highly accurate result, saving a long time in mathematical calculations, easier and comfort in using for all mechatronics and robotics designers and engineers.

AB  - Automation is advancing relentlessly. Already decades ago, digitization was its partner. In the industry, innovative robots, for example co-robots, are used. Service robots begin to spread in various areas. Systems of artificial intelligence perform tasks of all sorts, even creative activities. The studies on the development of the labor market reach different results. In any case, it can be said that certain jobs will disappear and many people will have to do without their familiar work. It can also be assumed that in many areas less human work has to be performed on behalf (e.g., for customers and employers). As possible solutions to economic and social problems, an unconditional basic income and a robot tax are suggested. This paper presents, discusses and criticizes these approaches in the context of automation and digitization. Moreover, it develops a relatively unknown proposal, unconditional basic property, and presents its potentials as well as its risks. © 2019 CEUR-WS. All rights reserved.

AB  - Autonomous robots will most likely replace human labour as the primary means of production in bridge construction. This article examines the effect of this transformation of construction on the design of structural systems used for bridges. It begins with a review of changes made to structural systems in response to increases in construction wages in the 1950s and 1960s. High labour costs led to structural systems that were optimized to minimize the quantity of labour but which used materials inefficiently. The expected use of robots as the primary means of production in bridge construction is likely to have the opposite effect. Robots will lower the cost of production relative to human labour, thus making it worthwhile to design structural systems that use materials efficiently. Cast-in-place concrete holds good potential for use as the primary material in this new generation of efficient structural systems. Structural systems that proved themselves in the era of low construction wages prior to mechanization offer a solid basis for the development structural systems that take maximum advantage of the opportunities offered by robotic construction. © 20th Congress of IABSE, New York City 2019: The Evolving Metropolis - Report.

AB  - Online peer-to-peer (P2P) lending platforms face multiple challenges in today's e-commerce, but one of the most outstanding concerns evaluating loan risk based on borrowers' financial status and histories. Traditionally, financial experts assess borrowers' risk of default payments manually, but this process is tedious and time consuming, which are not widely applicable concerns for online P2P platforms. This paper proposes a hybrid of the simulated annealing and the extreme gradient boosting machine models in order to predict the likelihood of default payments based on users' finance histories. Based on the experimental results, the proposed model demonstrates its predictability with high recall scores. The proposed model not only out-performs over conventional algorithms including logistic regressions, support vector machines, random forests, and artificial neural networks, but it also provides an efficient method for optimising hyper-parameters in the machine learning algorithms. Through the utilisation of the proposed data-driven models, the necessity of tedious and potentially inaccurate human labour can be significantly reduced, and service level agreements (SLAs) can be further improved by time reduction made possible through the introduction of advanced data mining approaches. © 2019 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

AB  - Collaborative Human-Robot workcells introduce robot-assisted operations in small-volume production or assembly processes, where conventional automation is noncompetitive. Unfortunately, the collaborative work of humans and robots sharing the same work area and/or working on the same assembly operation may pose unprecedented problems and failure risks. Failure Mode, Effects and Criticality Analysis (FMECA) is a popular tool to design reliable processes, which investigates the potential failure modes from the perspective of severity, occurrence and detection. The traditional FMECA approach requires the assessment of failure modes to be carried out collectively by a group of experts. Nevertheless, in the field of Human-Robot collaboration, experts are often unlikely to agree in their judgements, due to the almost inexistent historical records. Additionally, the traditional approach is not appropriate for decentralized production/assembly processes. The paper revisits the traditional approach and integrates it with the ZMII-technique – i.e., a recent aggregation technique developed by the authors – which overcomes some limitations, including but not limited to: (i) arbitrary categorization and questionable aggregation of the expert judgments, (ii) disregarding the variability in these judgments, and (iii) disregarding the result uncertainty. The description is supported by a real-life application example. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2019.

AB  - We investigate the impact of new digital technologies upon occupations. We argue that these impacts may be both destructive and transformative. The destructive effects of digitalization substitute human labor, while transformative effects of digitalization complement it. We distinguish between four broad groups of occupations that differ with regard to the impact of digitalization upon them. “Rising star” occupations are characterized by the low destructive and high transformative effects of digitalization. In contrast, “collapsing” occupations face a high risk of destructive effects. “Human terrain” occupations have low risks of both destructive and transformative digitalization, whereas “machine terrain” occupations are affected by both types. We analyze the differences between these four occupational groups in terms of the capabilities, which can be considered bottlenecks to computerization. The results help to identify which capabilities will be in demand and to what degree workers with different abilities can expect their occupations to be transformed in the digital era. © 2019, National Research University, Higher School of Econoimics.

AB  - Detection and classification of surface defects of the rolled metal are one of the main tasks for correctly assessing product quality. Historically, these tasks were performed by a human. However, due to a multitude of production factors, such as high rolling rate and temperature of the metal, the results of such human work are rather low. Replacing a human controller with an artificial intelligence system has been relevant for a long time; it is merely necessary within the concept of Industry 4.0. This paper is devoted to the development of the prototype system automatic detection and classification of defects for one of the Iron-and-Steel Works of the Chelyabinsk region in the Russian Federation. The prototype consists of the Preprocessor, Classifier, Server, Database, and User interface. The main focus is on achieving high classification accuracy, which is planned to be obtained through the use of convolutional neural networks. © Faculty of Mechanical Engineering, Belgrade.

AB  - Quantifying tree biomass is a critical process for carbon stock estimation at the stand, landscape, and national levels. A major challenge for forest managers is the amount of effort involved to document carbon storage levels, especially in terms of human labor. In this paper, we propose a method to quantify the amount of carbon in forest stands. In our approach, we obtain aerial images from where we build 3D reconstructions of the terrain. Using the resulting orthomosaics, we identify individual trees and process their point clouds to extract information to estimate tree the height and to infer the diameter, which we employ in allometric equations to compute carbon content. We compare our results with carbon estimates obtained from allometric equations applied to manual tree diameter and height measurements. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Many researchers in the field of machine learning have addressed the problem of detecting anomalies within Computed Tomography (CT) scans. Training these machine learning algorithms requires a dataset of CT scans with identified anomalies (labels), usually, in specific organs. This represents a problem, since it requires experts to review thousands of images in order to create labels for these data. We aim to decrease human burden at labeling CT scans by developing a model that identifies anomalies within plain-text-based reports that then could be further used as a method to create labels for models based on CT scans. This study contains more than 4800 CT reports from Duke Health System, for which we aim to identify organ specific abnormalities. We propose an iterative active learning approach that consists of building a machine learning model to classify CT reports by abnormalities in different organs and then improving it by actively adding reports sequentially. At each iteration, clinical experts review the report that provides the model with highest expected information gain. This process is done in real time by using a web interface. Then, this datum is used by the model to improve its performance. We evaluated the performance of our method for abnormalities in kidneys and lungs. When starting with a model trained on 99 reports, the results show the model achieves an Area Under the Curve (AUC) score of 0.93 on the test set after adding 130 actively labeled reports to the model from an unlabeled pool of 4,000. This suggests that a set of labeled CT scans can be obtained with significantly reduced human work by combining machine learning techniques and clinical experts' knowledge. © 2019 SPIE.

AB  - In the coming two decades, automation is expected to significantly displace new categories of human labor forces, as artificial intelligence (AI) and mobile robotics (MR) increasingly take on non-routine cognitive tasks. While designers, educators, and technologists fare relatively well in the overall susceptibility-to-displacement rankings, they will nonetheless need to grapple with the impact of blended, moving systems that are capable of emulating causal reasoning and human insight. This article briefly chronicles the trajectory of AI and robotics research over the last fifty years, describes some of the unique dilemmas inherent in complex human-computer interactions, and proposes a mode of engagement with automated systems for designers and engineers centered on communication, behavior, and interdisciplinary knowledge. In particular, designers’ various expertise in articulating tools, expressing meaning, and shaping user experiences are presented as essential ingredients for cultivating effective interactions between humans and machines. Moreover, by modeling inclusivity, dialogue, and positive social behaviors, designers can encourage people to recognize and safeguard human capacities for learning, reciprocity, civility, and labor as long-term advantages. © Common Ground, Alex Liebergesell, Some Rights Reserved,

AB  - In recent years, along with the aging of society worldwide, decrease of working population has become a serious problem. For this reason, robots are expected to substitute human work, automate distribution, and support human daily life, especially, elderly care assistance. In this research, we focus on the support of those who need care in everyday life, and, in this paper, we propose a human-robot cooperative system that supports acquisition of objects in cooperation with a human. The outline of the action of this robot is as follows: (i) It moves to the location designated by a user autonomously (not by remote control): (ii) On arrival, the robot exchanges information by video with the user who is at a remote place, and acquires the objects designated by the user among those placed there. (iii) After the acquisition, the robot moves again autonomously to the user and hands over the objects to the user. In this paper, we focus on step (ii) and show methods and some experimental results. © COPYRIGHT SPIE.

AB  - Projects that set out to create a linguistic resource often do so by using a machine learning model that pre-annotates or filters the content that goes through to a human annotator, before going into the final version of the resource. However, available budgets are often limited, and the amount of data that is available exceeds the amount of annotation that can be done. Thus, in order to optimize the benefit from the invested human work, we argue that the decision on which predictive model one should employ depends not only on generalized evaluation metrics, such as accuracy and F-score, but also on the gain metric. The rationale is that, the model with the highest F-score may not necessarily have the best separation and sequencing of predicted classes, thus leading to the investment of more time and/or money on annotating false positives, yielding zero improvement of the linguistic resource. We exemplify our point with a case study, using real data from a task of building a verb-noun idiom dictionary. We show that in our scenario, given the choice of three systems with varying F-scores, the system with the highest F-score does not yield the highest profits. In other words, we show that the cost-benefit trade off can be more favorable if a system with a lower F-score is employed. © LREC 2018 - 11th International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation.

AB  - Background: Manual extraction of information from electronic pathology (epath) reports to populate the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Result (SEER) database is labor intensive. Systematizing the data extraction automatically using machine-learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) is desirable to reduce the human labor required to populate the SEER database and to improve the timeliness of the data. This enables scaling up registry efficiency and collection of new data elements. To ensure the integrity, quality, and continuity of the SEER data, the misclassification error of ML and NPL algorithms needs to be negligible. Current algorithms fail to achieve the precision of human experts who can bring additional information in their assessments. Differences in registry format and the desire to develop a common information extraction platform further complicate the ML/NLP tasks. The purpose of our study is to develop triage rules to partially automate registry workflow to improve the precision of the auto-extracted information. Results: This paper presents a mathematical framework to improve the precision of a classifier beyond that of the Bayes classifier by selectively classifying item that are most likely to be correct. This results in a triage rule that only classifies a subset of the item. We characterize the optimal triage rule and demonstrate its usefulness in the problem of classifying cancer site from electronic pathology reports to achieve a desired precision. Conclusions: From the mathematical formalism, we propose a heuristic estimate for triage rule based on post-processing the soft-max output from standard machine learning algorithms. We show, in test cases, that the triage rule significantly improve the classification accuracy. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Driving Heavy Duty Vehicles (HDVs) as a platoon has potential to significantly reduce the fuel consumption, human labor and increase the safety. A suitable controller which can maintain the vehicle movement in a defined topology is essential for HDV platooning. This paper proposes a controller based on the combination of Constant Distance (CD) and Headway Time (HT) topologies using Model Predictive Control (MPC) for a longitudinal HDVs platoon. In addition to this, a MPC controller is compared with conventional PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) controller. The controller aims to maintain intervehicular distance and headway time between the vehicles for two cases, namely unconstrained and constrained optimization problem. The predictive control algorithm uses a kinematic model of vehicle platooning. A systematic handling of constraints yields significant improvements in the performance of the proposed MPC strategy over conventional PID controller. A road network of a U.S. freeway I5 has been built in VISSIM for the simulations. The results and discussions are at the end of the paper. © 2018 IEEE.

AB  - The authors investigated the effect of gaze tracking by agent for human. Psychological study has shown that presence of others facilitates efforts of working partner. This effect also occurs if the presence of others replaced to robot. Furthermore, previous research shows that the effects on a person being touched by a robot to motivate him or her. However, direct contact such as touch with robot has a risk of disturbing human work. The authors use gaze tracking for social facilitation, because gaze tracking can also facilitate human efforts. The authors implemented social facilitation robot agent by using gaze tracking. The agent projects its face on the surface to show quickly changing expression which is difficult for achieve by ordinally robots. The agent also can express gaze tracking by implemented eye trackers. The authors prepared three conditions with monotonous task for comparing the effect of gaze tracking, first: the agent gazes the aim of task, second: the agent moves its gaze randomly, third: the agent traces the gaze point of participant. The result showed that the participant raise motivation if the agent traces gazed point by human, even though there are no the different on achievement score of task and continuation time. © 2018 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - Will advances in robotics, artificial intelligence, and machine learning put vast swaths of the labor force out of work or into fierce competition for the jobs that remain? Or, as in the past, will new jobs absorb workers displaced by automation? These hotly debated questions have profound implications for the fortress of rights and benefits that has been constructed on the foundation of the employment relationship. This Article charts a path for reforming that body of law in the face of justified anxiety and uncertainty about the future impact of automation on jobs. Many of the forces that drive automation—including law-related labor costs—also drive firms’ decisions about “fissuring,” or replacing employees with outside contractors. Fissuring has already transformed the landscape of work and contributed to weaker labor standards and growing inequality. A sensible response to automation should have in mind this adjacent problem, and vice versa. Unfortunately, the dominant legal responses to fissuring—which aim to extend firms’ legal responsibility for the workers whose labor they rely on—do not meet the distinctive challenge of automation, and even modestly exacerbate it. Automation offers the ultimate exit from the costs and risks associated with human labor. As technology becomes an ever-more-capable and costeffective substitute for human workers, it enables firms to circumvent prevailing legal strategies for protecting workers and shoring up the fortress of employment. The question is how to protect workers’ rights and entitlements while reducing firms’ incentive both to replace employees with contractors and to replace human workers with machines. The answer, I argue, begins with separating the issue of what workers’ entitlements should be from the issue of where their economic burdens should fall. Some worker rights and entitlements necessarily entail employer duties and burdens. But for those that do not, we should look for ways to shift their costs off of employer payrolls or to extend the entitlements themselves beyond employment. The existing fortress of employment-based rights and benefits is under assault from fissuring and automation; it is failing to protect those who remain outside its walls and erecting barriers to some who seek to enter. We should dismantle some of its fortifications and construct in its place a broader foundation of economic security for all, including those who cannot or do not make their living through steady employment. © 2018, Yale Law Journal.

AB  - Robotics are extensively utilized in modern industry to replace human labor and achieve high automation and flexibility. In order to produce large-size products, two-sided assembly lines are widely applied, where robotics can be employed to operate tasks on workstations. Since the applied traditional optimization methods are limited, the current work presented a new discrete cuckoo search algorithm to solve the two-sided robotic assembly line balancing problem. The original cuckoo search algorithm was modified by employing neighbor operations. Furthermore, a new procedure to generate individuals to replace the abandoned nests was developed to enhance the intensification. Since the considered problem has two subproblems, namely the robot allocation and assembly line balancing, the present work extended the cuckoo search algorithm to cooperative coevolutionary paradigm by dividing the cuckoos into two sub-swarms, each addressing a subproblem. In order to emphasize the exploration, a restart mechanism was employed. The proposed discrete algorithm’s evolution process and convergence were compared with another two popular optimization algorithms, namely the genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimization algorithm. Computational study on the proposed algorithms and other five recent algorithms along with statistical analysis demonstrated that the proposed methods yielded promising results. © 2017, The Natural Computing Applications Forum.

AB  - High Definition map (HD Map) is an important part of autonomous driving vehicle. Most conventional method to generate HD map requires expensive system and postprocessing of observed data. In this paper, we propose automatic HD map generating algorithm using just monocular camera without further human labors. The proposed algorithm detects road lane from image and classifies the type of road lane at pixel-level with Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) which outperforms the other semantic segmentation methods. The segmentation results are used to extract lane features, and the features are used for loop-closure detection. Final map is generated with graph-based Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) algorithm. The experiment is done with monocular camera mounted on mobile vehicle. In this paper, final map generated by proposed method is compared with aerial view data. The results show that the proposed method can generate reliable map that is comparable to real roads even only the low-cost sensor is used. © 2018 IEEE.

AB  - Indoor positioning technology based on Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) fingerprints is a potential navigation solution, which has the advantages of simple implementation, low cost and high precision. However, as the radio frequency signals can be easily affected by the environmental change during its transmission, it is quite necessary to build location fingerprint database in advance and update it frequently, thereby guaranteeing the positioning accuracy. At present, the fingerprint database building methods mainly include point collection and line acquisition, both of which are usually labor-intensive and time consuming, especially in a large map area. This paper proposes a fast and efficient location fingerprint database construction and updating method based on a self-developed Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) platform NAVIS, called Automatic Robot Line Collection. A smartphone was installed on NAVIS for collecting indoor Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) fingerprints of Signals of Opportunity (SOP), such as Bluetooth and Wi-Fi. Meanwhile, indoor map was created by 2D LiDAR-based Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) technology. The UGV automatically traverse the unknown indoor environment due to a pre-designed full-coverage path planning algorithm. Then, SOP sensors collect location fingerprints and generates grid map during the process of environment-traversing. Finally, location fingerprint database is built or updated by Kriging interpolation. Field tests were carried out to verify the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method. The results showed that, compared with the traditional point collection and line collection schemes, the root mean square error of the fingerprinting-based positioning results were reduced by 35.9% and 25.0% in static tests and 30.0% and 21.3% respectively in dynamic tests. Moreover, our UGV can traverse the indoor environment autonomously without human-labor on data acquisition, the efficiency of the automatic robot line collection scheme is 2.65 times and 1.72 times that of the traditional point collection and the traditional line acquisition, respectively. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - Chatbots are software used in entertainment industry, businesses and user support. Chatbots are modeled on various techniques such as knowledge base, machine learning based. Machine learning based chatbots yields more practical results. Chatbot which gives responses based on the context of conversation tends to be more user friendly. The chatbot we are proposing demonstrates a method of developing chatbot which can follow the context of the conversation. This method uses TensorFlow for developing the neural network model of the chatbot and uses the nlp techniques to maintain the context of the conversation. This chatbots can be used in small industries or business for automating customer care as user queries will be handled by chatbots thus reducing need of human labour and expenditure. © 2018 IEEE.

AB  - Left atrium shape has been shown to be an independent predictor of recurrence after atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation. Shape-based representation is imperative to such an estimation process, where correspondence-based representation offers the most flexibility and ease-of-computation for population-level shape statistics. Nonetheless, population-level shape representations in the form of image segmentation and correspondence models derived from cardiac MRI require significant human resources with sufficient anatomy-specific expertise. In this paper, we propose a machine learning approach that uses deep networks to estimate AF recurrence by predicting shape descriptors directly from MRI images, with NO image pre-processing involved. We also propose a novel data augmentation scheme to effectively train a deep network in a limited training data setting. We compare this new method of estimating shape descriptors from images with the state-of-the-art correspondence-based shape modeling that requires image segmentation and correspondence optimization. Results show that the proposed method and the current state-of-the-art produce statistically similar outcomes on AF recurrence, eliminating the need for expensive pre-processing pipelines and associated human labor. © 2018 Creative Commons Attribution.

AB  - In the last several years, technological progress has accelerated rapidly. Artificial intelligence (AI) has brought self-driving cars to our streets, super-automation to our factories, deep learning algorithms that beat world champions, image recognition programs that diagnose cancer more accurately than experienced oncologists can, voice recognition machines that understand speech on a par with humans and a host of other achievements which would have been hard to imagine even a decade ago. The critical interest, however, is not in what has been accomplished, but rather where technolog y is going and what will be the implications of forthcoming advances in all aspects of our lives, work and societies, including the possibility, some argue, of mass unemployment and huge income inequalities, as machines and robots powered by AI replace human labor. It is the purpose of this paper to discuss AI and related technological advancements and consider their implications for humanity in general and for a small country like Cyprus in particular. The paper is organized into three parts. It first looks at AI and its achievements and considers four scenarios of how it could affect us. In the second part, the paper presents a complementary to AI technolog y, that of intelligence augmentation (IA) that provides a different perspective to where technolog y is leading us and the implications involved. The final, third part considers the consequences of AI and IA for Cyprus and what would need to be done to exploit their advantages whilst minimizing their drawbacks. © 2019, University of Nicosia.

AB  - The rust removing process on the surface of a steel material by robotic systems is more efficient and effective than human's work in the infrastructure maintenance. However, the existing rust removing robotic systems cannot automatically remove the rust according to the condition of the rusted area on the steel material. To solve this problem, several rust detection methods were proposed. Unfortunately, this problem is still a challenge due to the condition change during the rust removing process. In this paper, we propose a rust detection method which can work during the rust grinding process with a developed rust grinding platform. The proposed method is divided into two parts. The first part is called Qualified Image Detection (QID) to detect the rusted steel image without other objects included. The second part is the rust detection from the qualified image. Since the rust powder affects the rust detection result obviously, a technique is applied in our method to decrease the influence. The experiments were conducted on the developed grinding platform to show the validity of the proposed method. © 2018 IEEE.

AB  - Advances in artificial intelligence and robotics may be leading to a new industrial revolution. This paper presents a model with the minimum necessary features to analyze the implications for inequality and output. Two assumptions are key: “robot” capital is distinct from traditional capital in its degree of substitutability with human labor; and only capitalists and skilled workers save. We analyze a range of variants that reflect widely different views of how automation may transform the labor market. Our main results are surprisingly robust: automation is good for growth and bad for equality; in the benchmark model real wages fall in the short run and eventually rise, but “eventually” can easily take generations. © 2018

AB  - The robotic arm is a robot that is used in the manufacturing industry. It has been used as a substitute for human labor in continuous work on 24 hours a day, tasks that need to be repeated all the time, dangerous jobs, and hard work that humans cannot do. Usually, humans can do everything; however, they are not able to work continuously for a long time because humans get tired and so they need to rest. This paper proposes a development of base of robot arm using Finite Element Analysis method to analyze and evaluate of the material of new base of robot arm. The influential factors affecting the parts of base of robot arm are studied and analyzed. The results of the plastic PA GF30 show that can be used to replace the cast iron base, the plastic material will reduce the overall cost material by 15 %. and the weight reduce from cast iron by 80 % © 2018 IEEE.

AB  - We present the main messages of a European Expert Round Table (ERT) on the unintended side effects (unseens) of the digital transition. Seventeen experts provided 42 propositions from ten different perspectives as input for the ERT. A full-day ERT deliberated communalities and relationships among these unseens and provided suggestions on (i) what the major unseens are; (ii) how rebound effects of digital transitioning may become the subject of overarching research; and (iii) what unseens should become subjects of transdisciplinary theory and practice processes for developing socially robust orientations. With respect to the latter, the experts suggested that the "ownership, economic value, use and access of data" and, related to this, algorithmic decision-making call for transdisciplinary processes that may provide guidelines for key stakeholder groups on how the responsible use of digital data can be developed. A cluster-based content analysis of the propositions, the discussion and inputs of the ERT, and a theoretical analysis of major changes to levels of human systems and the human-environment relationship resulted in the following greater picture: The digital transition calls for redefining economy, labor, democracy, and humanity. Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based machines may take over major domains of human labor, reorganize supply chains, induce platform economics, and reshape the participation of economic actors in the value chain. (Digital) Knowledge and data supplement capital, labor, and natural resources as major economic variables. Digital data and technologies lead to a post-fuel industry (post-) capitalism. Traditional democratic processes can be (intentionally or unintentionally) altered by digital technologies. The unseens in this field call for special attention, research and management. Related to the conditions of ontogenetic and phylogenetic development (humanity), the ubiquitous, global, increasingly AI-shaped interlinkage of almost every human personal, social, and economic activity and the exposure to indirect, digital, artificial, fragmented, electronically mediated data affect behavioral, cognitive, psycho-neuro-endocrinological processes on the level of the individual and thus social relations (of groups and families) and culture, and thereby, the essential quality and character of the human being (i.e., humanity). The findings suggest a need for a new field of research, i.e., focusing on sustainable digital societies and environments, in which the identification, analysis, and management of vulnerabilities and unseens emerging in the sociotechnical digital transition play an important role. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - Machine learning is one of the most important and successful techniques in contemporary computer science. Although it can be applied to myriad problems of human interest, research in machine learning is often framed in an impersonal way, as merely algorithms being applied to model data. However, this viewpoint hides considerable human work of tuning the algorithms, gathering the data, deciding what should be modeled in the first place, and using the outcomes of machine learning in the real world. Examining machine learning from a human-centered perspective includes explicitly recognizing human work, as well as reframing machine learning workflows based on situated human working practices, and exploring the co-adaptation of humans and intelligent systems. A human-centered understanding of machine learning in human contexts can lead not only to more usable machine learning tools, but to new ways of understanding what machine learning is good for and how to make it more useful. This special issue brings together nine articles that present different ways to frame machine learning in a human context. They represent very different application areas (from medicine to audio) and methodologies (including machine learning methods, human-computer interaction methods, and hybrids), but they all explore the human contexts in which machine learning is used. This introduction summarizes the articles in this issue and draws out some common themes. 2018 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly reshaping service by performing various tasks, constituting a major source of innovation, yet threatening human jobs. We develop a theory of AI job replacement to address this double-edged impact. The theory specifies four intelligences required for service tasks—mechanical, analytical, intuitive, and empathetic—and lays out the way firms should decide between humans and machines for accomplishing those tasks. AI is developing in a predictable order, with mechanical mostly preceding analytical, analytical mostly preceding intuitive, and intuitive mostly preceding empathetic intelligence. The theory asserts that AI job replacement occurs fundamentally at the task level, rather than the job level, and for “lower” (easier for AI) intelligence tasks first. AI first replaces some of a service job’s tasks, a transition stage seen as augmentation, and then progresses to replace human labor entirely when it has the ability to take over all of a job’s tasks. The progression of AI task replacement from lower to higher intelligences results in predictable shifts over time in the relative importance of the intelligences for service employees. An important implication from our theory is that analytical skills will become less important, as AI takes over more analytical tasks, giving the “softer” intuitive and empathetic skills even more importance for service employees. Eventually, AI will be capable of performing even the intuitive and empathetic tasks, which enables innovative ways of human–machine integration for providing service but also results in a fundamental threat for human employment. © 2018, © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - Parkinsonian gait is associated with life-threatening consequences such as fall risk in Parkinson patients. Conventional Parkinsonian gait analysis heavily relies on expensive sensors and human labor. In this work, we propose a sensor-free end-to-end system which enables the automated and accurate Parkinsonian gait detection and analysis upon the videos recorded by pervasive cameras. Specifically, we leverage Deep Learning technologies to extract the human skeleton in the video frame and address the camera random angle challenge. By analyzing the gait features, we train a classifier based on a binary decision tree. Out of 16 Parkinsonian gait and 13 healthy gait videos, our system is able to detect the Parkinsonian Gait with 93.75% accuracy and healthy gait with 100% accuracy. © 2018 IEEE.

AB  - With the increasing number of human-robot interaction applications, robot control characteristics and their effects on safety as well as performance should be taken account into the robot control system. In this paper, a position and torque switching control method was proposed to improve the robot safety and performance, when robots and humans work in the same space. The switching control method includes two modes, the position control mode using a proportion-integral (PI) algorithm, and the torque control mode using sliding mode control (SMC) algorithm for eliminating swing. Under the normal condition, the robot works in position control mode for trajectory tracking with quick response. Once the robot and human collide, the robot will switch to torque control mode immediately, and the impact force will be restricted within a safe range. When the robot and human detach, the robot will resume to position control mode automatically. Moreover, for a better performance, the joint torque is detected from direct-current (DC) motor’s current rather than the torque sensor. The experiment results show that the proposed approach is effective and feasible. © 2018, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Currently, the griping force estimation of using the linear prediction model built on static (isometric) contraction is low accurate in human works, especially at varied grasp motion. The objective of this study is to build an accurate Surface Electromyography (SEMG)-handgrip force model for estimating the handgrip force during dynamic (non-isometric) contraction tasks. Ten healthy individuals performed several MVC tasks and a series of dynamic sub-maximal force (SMF) tasks to obtain a suit of normalization ratio samples. Suitable nonlinear function is selected to fit the nonlinear SEMG-force relationship during the regression procedure. After that, ten subjects performed three dynamic evaluated contraction tasks (0-70% MVC) to analyze performance of the proposed model and compare it with performance of the former model. The experimental results show that the proposed force estimation model can evaluate handgrip force more accurate than former one in dynamic grasp condition. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - Precision Agriculture using mobile robot aimed to increase efficiency and quality of crops treatment and monitoring, since robot can produce better result in term of data quality and accuracy than manual treatment by human labor. Limited by technology development and complexity of agricultural environment, precision agriculture nowadays is still not fully-autonomous, but partially autonomous to handle more simpler - but need high accuracy - tasks. Some of them is mapping and monitoring task. This research proposed a method for generating map in simulated agricultural area using Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM), by generating grid-based/volumetric map using fine-tuned SLAM-Gmapping algorithm and combine it with properties/informations obtained from each detected crops/plants using fruit detection with visual sensor and tree location detection using 2D laser scanner sensor. Experiment conducted in simulation environment Gazebo and Robot Operation System (ROS) for scenario of simulated fruit mapping in apple farm, and give a good result with a good accuracy. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - Recent improvement in robotics has sharply increased the adoption rate of robotic systems as robots are now more cost-effective when compared to human labor and a lot easier to use. Consequently, more people with little or no experience of line design are overseeing line automation. This paper proposes an easy-to-use tool with an application in a car-body shop - extension for application to other processes is feasible with minor modifications. In car-body shops, most of the operations are performed by robots that load and weld stamped steel parts. These robots are organized in cells separated by buffers. One of the main objectives of car-body shop designers is to keep cost as low as possible with no impact on the production rate and the quality of the parts produced. To do that, they have at their disposal two main levers: the size of buffers and the number of robots. Adding more buffers could reduce the impact of disruptions and, consequently, increase the production rate. On the other hand, adding robots will speed up the lines which would also increase the production rate. Both add significant but different costs. Also, additional robots means additional failures, and this may reduce or reverse the increase in production rate. Given a target production rate, the goal of the method submitted in this paper is to help production line designers answer the following questions: What robot and buffer space allocation will meet the target at least cost? This paper proposes a judicious analytic solution based on simplifying yet realistic assumptions. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - Unsupervised feature learning has played an important role in machine learning due to its ability to save human labor cost. Since the absence of labels in such scenario, a commonly used approach is to select features according to the similarity matrix derived from the original feature space. However, their similarity matrices suffer from noises and redundant features, with which are frequently confronted in high-dimensional data. In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised feature selection algorithm. Compared with the previous works, there are mainly two merits of the proposed algorithm: (1) The similarity matrix is adaptively adjusted with a comprehensive strategy to fully utilize the information in the projected data and the original data. (2) To guarantee the clarity of the dramatically learned manifold structure, a non-squared l2-norm based sparsity method is imposed into the objective function. The proposed objective function involves several non-smooth constraints, making it difficult to solve. We also design an efficient iterative algorithm to optimize it. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms on several kinds of publicly available datasets. © 2017

AB  - Background: Technology in the healthcare sector is undergoing rapid development. One of the most prominent areas of healthcare in which robots are implemented is nursing homes. However, nursing and technology are often considered as being contradictory, an attitude originating in the view of “the natural” versus “the artificial”. Social media mirror this view, including in attitudes and societal debates regarding nursing and care robots. However, little is known about this topic in previous research. Objectives: To examine user behaviour in social media platforms on the topic of nursing and care robots. Design. retrospective and cross-sectional observation study design was applied. Methods: Data were collected via the Alchemy streaming application programming interface. Data from social media were collected fro. January 2014 t. January 2016. The data set consisted of 12,311 mentions in total. Results: Nursing and care robots ar. small-scale topic of discussion in social media. Twitter was found to be the largest channel in terms of volume, followed by Tumblr. News channels had the highest percentage of visibility, while forums and Tumblr had the least. It was found in the data that 67.9% of the mentions were positive, 24.4% were negative and 7.8% were neutral. Discussion: The volume and visibility of the data on nursing robots found in social media, as well as the attitudes to nursing robots found there, indicate that nursing care robots, which are seen as representin. next step in technological development in healthcare, ar. topic on the rise in social media. These findings are likely to be related to the idea that nursing care robots are on the breakthrough of replacing human labour in healthcare worldwide. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - This paper focuses the shift in human culture and society, delivered by the digital revolution. Due to an expected dematerialization of the most future products and services the contradiction between the classical value of a commodity, negotiated in the traditional exchange systems and the digital economy will further increase. This again will contribute to dramatic changes in production, rendering gigantic industrial complexes obsolete, which puts the personal creativity as an eternal, never expiring source of inspiration, art, design and high elaborated products into the focus. Starting from this point we want to explore how future-oriented education can meaningfully interlink the widely chaotic processes of art and design production, the absolute necessary fuzziness of an artist’s mind with the cool and sometimes unforgiving logic of the digital machines. We are deeply convinced that this is not a matter of interface-design anymore. That’s why we want to go beyond any conventions and rethink higher education in the domain of art and design related creativity, virtuosity and intellectuality under the impact of the digital revolution from the beginning. By conducting an analytic review of the mindsets and methods applied here, we are expecting to face the major challenge in defining the criteria, which are allowing us to establish and to sustain a dynamic balance between the needs of the carbon beings and the possibilities of their siliconized representations - far apart from buzzword centered platitudes. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.

AB  - In recent years, generative model using neural network (GAN) has become an interesting field in machine learning. However, a study that investigates the effect of reducing training dataset for GAN model has not been conducted, while it is known that collecting images for training dataset requires a lot of human labor work. In this research, series of experiments with various amount of dataset have been conducted to get the idea of how small is the amount of dataset required for a GAN to work. It has been shown that the reduction to around fifty thousand images of dataset has gained a better result than a full amount dataset. Additionally, a new evaluation method for quantifying the performance of GAN network was also proposed, which can be considered later as another evaluation method for GAN framework. © 2018 The Authors.

AB  - The objective of this research is to compute the inverse kinematics and control of a trajectory for a robotic arm, which is using in chemical industries such as plastic, polymer, pharmaceuticals and chemistry production. Workers in chemical factories sometimes causing some errors during the packaging process, as well as high production costs and time spent on implementation, therefore, it is better to replace this human work with programmable robotic arms that can be implemented with maximum precision, and also reduce the cost of these operations from the previous one. In addition, the main advantage of using these manipulators is automating control without losing working time or boredom and quality evaluation within chemical production lines. This study was done by using a new developed geometrical approach method to compute inverse kinematics problems with a highly accurate result, saving a long time in mathematical calculations, easier and comfort in using for mechatronics and robotics designers and engineers. The advantages of this research, first is to design and study an inverse kinematics of Four Degree of Freedom as Revolute-Revolute-Revolute-Revolute joints 4-DOF (RRRR) Manipulator robot (such as exist in KUKA 4R Robot), second is to control of end-effector trajectory, finding of all possible solutions with selection the optimal trajectory. An investigation of inverse kinematics software program of KUKA manipulator robot was developed to save time and cost with regards to reprogramming efforts. Obtained results can be implemented in food and biotechnology industry, cryogenics and other industries. © International Research Publication House.

AB  - Recognizing human emotions from pieces of natural language has been a challenging task in artificial intelligence, for the difficulty of acquiring high-quality training examples. In this paper, we propose a novel method based on active learning to progressively improve the performance of supervised text emotion classification models, with as few human labor as possible in annotating the training examples. Specifically, the active learning algorithm interactively communicates with the supervised emotion classification model to find the potentially most effective training examples from a huge set of unlabeled data and increases the training data by acquiring emotion labels for these examples from the human experts. Our experiment of multi-label emotion classification on Japanese tweets suggests that the proposed method is effective in steadily improving the supervised classification results by incrementally feeding a classification model with the new tweets of well-balanced emotion labels. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2018.

AB  - This paper presents the use of machine learning techniques for the development of a methodology for the analysis of digital images of citrus plants collected from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Proven ground based sensors including a chlorophyll meter, water potential meter, and spectroradiometer are used to evaluate the condition of the plants, thus providing the ground truth. The collected images and ground truth data are then used as training data to the machine learning models, which are validated using a separate set of data. For our models, we evaluate several machine learning techniques from simple linear regression to convolutional neural networks. The overall goal is to develop a solution for monitoring plant health that can readily and cost-effectively be used by farmers to determine nitrogen and water stresses in plants. Such a system will aid in the conservation of physical resources while reducing human labor and the environmental impact of chemicals. © 2018 SPIE.

AB  - Effective intelligent fault diagnosis has long been a research focus on the condition monitoring of rotary machinery systems. Traditionally, time-domain vibration-based fault diagnosis has some deficiencies, such as complex computation of feature vectors, excessive dependence on prior knowledge and diagnostic expertise, and limited capacity for learning complex relationships in fault signals. Furthermore, following the increase in condition data, how to promptly process the massive fault data and automatically provide accurate diagnosis has become an urgent need to solve. Inspired by the idea of compressed sensing and deep learning, a novel intelligent diagnosis method is proposed for fault identification of rotating machines. In this paper, a nonlinear projection is applied to achieve the compressed acquisition, which not only reduces the amount of measured data that contained all the information of faults but also realizes the automatic feature extraction in transform domain. For exploring the discrimination hidden in the acquired data, a stacked sparse autoencoders-based deep neural network is established and performed with an unsupervised learning procedure followed by a supervised fine-tuning process. We studied the significance of compressed acquisition and provided the effects of key factors and comparison with traditional methods. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated using data sets from rolling element bearings and the analysis shows that it is able to obtain high diagnotic accuracies and is superior to the existing methods. The proposed method reduces the need of human labor and expertise and provides new strategy to handle the massive data more easily. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - In the modern industry, human-robot collaboration is becoming more and more important. With the quick development of the small production, the demand of flexibility is growing heavily. Gesture recognition is important for the collaborative work of humans and robots. In industrial applications, the performance of such systems affects the safety of human workers and their manufacturing efficiency. In this paper, we create a realistic human model in OpenSim, and use the Leap Motion to identify the action of a man's hand. Through the transmission of data measured by the Leap Motion, the model we have created in the OpenSim will correctly track the hand's movement, and make the corresponding motion. The experimental results show that the performance of this method is satisfactory. With the help of this method, we can simulate the precise movements of human hands in real time. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - In the geological exploration of the Adit, the texture, section, joint and other rock structural information are important factors to determine the stability of the Adit. Therefore, the collection and analysis of rock data information are the premise work and the key process of the safe production. Faced with the actual requirements of Adit 3D reconstruction, an automatic 3D reconstruction system is designed to replace human work. Aimed at and the special structure of the Adit, a novel mobile robotic platform is designed to realize the automatic image collection of the Adit. At the same time, this paper combines with SFM(Structure from Motion) algorithm and PMVS(Patch-based Multi-view Stereo) algorithm to realize automatic Adit 3D reconstruction. The experimental results show that this system can better replace human work to finish the task of Adit 3D reconstruction without any prior knowledge. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - Two major components of technological change, innovations in transport and the automation of human labour, have been shaping and will continue to shape the built environment in the years to come. The coming decades are expected to see a steady increase in automation across all industries. Cities and regions will experience a transition from today’s experimentation with semi-autonomous vehicles towards a future of fully autonomous vehicles. The Second Machine Age, a period of history centred on the automation of human cognitive functions, will transform cities by automating many aspects of daily life that generate the traffic patterns we experience today. How are urban areas to adapt to change with such far-reaching potential? Cities will first need to understand the impacts of this transformation and should respond by redoubling efforts to improve the human experience on multiple fronts. There will be an urgent need to build equitable environments and also creatively reuse infrastructure. Many urban areas may ultimately shift the focus away from transport as a defining feature of place. © 2017 Henry Stewart Publications. All Right Reserved.

AB  - Current manufacturing processes use robots for obtaining higher accuracy, higher precision, and fast response in the process. Deburring is one of important processes in metal forming processes. This research is aimed to design double arms SCARA robot for deburring process. The robot motion analysis used SolidWorks Motion Analysis in order to obtain the rotational angles of motors of the robot arms. In the motion analysis, two robot arms have identical rotational angles. They can also work parallel to each other as prescribed by users. The rotational angles were used to control the robot movement by using teach pendant method. The result shown that robot can be deburred two of the 10 holes of PCB board within 60 second and reduced manufacturing time, which is 2 times of work of human workforce. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - There have been an increasing number of various machine learning-based models successfully proposed and applied for automatic chemical-induced disease (CID) relation extraction. They, however, usually require carefully handcrafted rich feature sets, which rely on expert knowledge, thus require expensive human labor but normally still cannot generalize data well enough. In this paper, we propose a CID relation extraction model that learns features automatically through a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) instead of traditional handcrafted features. We exploit the shortest dependency path between a disease and a chemical for identifying their CID relation. Dependency relations, with and without their direction information, are further investigated. Experimental results on benchmark datasets (namely the BioCreative V dataset) are very potential, demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed model for CID relation extraction. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - It is necessary that periodical inspection and maintenance of railway transportation systems, which is becoming more and more common day by day, is required. A typical rail line can range from a few kilometers to thousands of kilometers. It is not possible to control this length of railway line with human labor. For this purpose, rail inspection is done automatically by machine vision today. The input data of machine vision systems consists of data from high-resolution cameras and other sensors. These data are evaluated by machine learning methods and the diagnosis result is produced. However, the data rate and the amount of data that occur in both long-distance and long-time repetitive ray inspection applications are huge. Proper handling, storage and analysis of this data requires a Big Data-based approach. In this study, an approach is proposed for the evaluation of large data obtained from vision-based diagnostic systems and the extraction of useful information in tracked systems. The proposed approach has been verified using simulation and experimental data and the effectiveness of the approach, utility, usability, and other visual-based diagnostic approaches to be developed in directed systems have been demonstrated. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - In many countries, robots and automation techniques are being introduced in agriculture farms to reduce the human labour and to improve the yield. However, such technological initiatives are still lacking in India, although it is the leading producer of many vegetables and fruits, for example, coconuts. Some of the activities carried out in a coconut farm that requires human labor are coconut dehusking, loading and unloading of coconuts. Automating these activities in a coconut farm would require a robotic system to pick and transport coconuts, for which the primary need would be to detect coconuts in those environments under natural lighting conditions. Towards this, the work in this paper tests for the applicability of three most used computer vision based object detection approaches namely, Local Binary Pattern (LBP) cascade, Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) cascade and Haar-like cascade in coconut detection. This vision system would enable any field robot to automate the tasks in coconut farms without human assistance. A comparative analysis using confusion matrix is carried on these three approaches. It is observed that Haar-like features provided comparably better results among all the three features, in terms of hit rate and precision. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - Document ranking is a central problem in many areas, including information retrieval and recommendation. .The goal of learning to rank is to automatically create ranking models from training data. .The performance of ranking models is strongly a.ected by the quality and quantity of training data. Collecting large scale training samples with relevance labels involves human labor which is timeconsuming and expensive. Selective sampling and active learning techniques have been developed and proven effective in addressing this problem. However, most active methods do not scale well and need to rebuild the model a.er selected samples are added to the previous training set. We propose a sampling method which selects a set of instances and labels the full set only once before training the ranking model. Our method is based on hierarchical agglomerative clustering (average linkage) and we also report the performance of other linkage criteria that measure the distance between two clusters of query-document pairs. Another di.erence from previous hierarchical clustering is that we cluster the instances belonging to the same query, which usually outperforms the baselines. © 2017 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - The main motivation to develop this work is to create a diagnosis system able to facilitate the work of human experts responsible for detecting faults before acquisition of submersible petroleum motor pump systems. A new approach for multiclass learning by reduction to multiple, binary classifiers, in a one-versus-one scheme, is presented as an alternative artificial intelligence solution to diagnose faults. Such an idea is based on the hypothesis that each pair of process conditions has different optimal feature sets to improve the classification performance. Thus, features are selected from datasets containing only two classes. Then, classifiers are trained with the selected features. The combination uses the average confidence of each classifier pair prediction to calculate the ensemble answer. Experimental results show that the proposed approach improves classification performance in a statistically significant way, when compared with correlated work. A secondary contribution is the analysis of the most difficult fault to be identified, namely rubbing. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - In recent times, several activities that lately were considered possible to do only by human work, have been replaced by the use of artificial intelligence. Recent researches have been developed to give computers a creativity ability as main objective. A type of related research is algorithmic composition. Traditionally evolutionary algorithms are successfully used for composing tasks, using a wide variety of fitness functions. This work presents a multiobjective approach that combines Fux's rules, from music theory, and functions that capture melodies' proportions, based on the Zipf's law, to compose monophonic melodies. Besides that, we propose a method that measures the amount of creativity contained in an algorithmic composition method. Experimental results show that the proposed methods have a good musical quality. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - Industrial robots exhibit how human labor can be automated due to the evolution of automation. The control of robotic manipulators for industrial applications is a booming field of research. Precision is one of the major factors that is taken into consideration for the evaluation of performance in such manipulators. In this paper, an algorithm has been developed for a point to point controlled 3 DOF model of a spatial robot. Further, simulation studies were carried out and also tested in real life. A set of inverse kinematic equations have been developed which enables to derive a relationship between joint angles, length of links and the desired position in relation to the initial position (Homing position). This is then compared to an algorithm that is designed using rotation matrices with small incremental prediction to achieve minimum error. An analysis between inverse kinematics and the simplified proposed algorithm is done to compare performance characteristics, primarily focusing on accuracy on repeated testing. The two results are compared and it is observed that the proposed algorithm gives better accuracy than the conventional method. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - Assembly process is one of the important aspects in manufacturing industries. Industries are extensively using advanced technologies in assembly lines recently such as robots instead of human labor. Cost associated with human labor such as wages, training, safety, and employee management are eliminated with the help of robots. Investments on assembly lines are cost intensive, and industries continuously need to maximize their utilization. In this paper, a cost-based robotic assembly line balancing (RALB) problem with an objective of minimizing assembly line cost and cycle time is addressed. Moreover, there is no research reported on concurrently optimizing cycle time and assembly line cost for a robotic assembly line system to date. The objective of this paper is to propose models with dual focus on time and cost to minimize the cycle time and total assembly line cost simultaneously. Time-based model with the primary focus to optimize cycle time and the cost-based model with the primary focus to optimize total assembly line cost are developed. Due to NP-hard nature, differential evolution (DE) is the algorithm used to solve the RALB problem. Straight and U-shaped robotic assembly line problems are solved using the proposed algorithm, and the detailed comparisons of the results obtained are presented. While comparing straight and U-shaped RALB problems, assembly line cost and cycle time obtained by U-shaped RALB problems are better than the straight RALB problems. The proposed models have significant managerial implications, and these have been discussed in detail. © 2016, Springer-Verlag London.

AB  - In modern manufacturing systems and industries, more and more research efforts have been made in developing effective machine health monitoring systems. Among various machine health monitoring approaches, data-driven methods are gaining in popularity due to the development of advanced sensing and data analytic techniques. However, considering the noise, varying length and irregular sampling behind sensory data, this kind of sequential data cannot be fed into classification and regression models directly. Therefore, previous work focuses on feature extraction/fusion methods requiring expensive human labor and high quality expert knowledge. With the development of deep learning methods in the last few years, which redefine representation learning from raw data, a deep neural network structure named Convolutional Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory networks (CBLSTM) has been designed here to address raw sensory data. CBLSTM firstly uses CNN to extract local features that are robust and informative from the sequential input. Then, bi-directional LSTM is introduced to encode temporal information. Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs) are able to capture long-term dependencies and model sequential data, and the bi-directional structure enables the capture of past and future contexts. Stacked, fully-connected layers and the linear regression layer are built on top of bi-directional LSTMs to predict the target value. Here, a real-life tool wear test is introduced, and our proposed CBLSTM is able to predict the actual tool wear based on raw sensory data. The experimental results have shown that our model is able to outperform several state-of-the-art baseline methods. © 2017 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Many recent works have demonstrated the benefits of knowledge graph embeddings in completing monolingual knowledge graphs. Inasmuch as related knowledge bases are built in several different languages, achieving cross-lingual knowledge alignment will help people in constructing a coherent knowledge base, and assist machines in dealing with different expressions of entity relationships across diverse human languages. Unfortunately, achieving this highly desirable crosslingual alignment by human labor is very costly and error-prone. Thus, we propose MTransE, a translation-based model for multilingual knowledge graph embeddings, to provide a simple and automated solution. By encoding entities and relations of each language in a separated embedding space, MTransE provides transitions for each embedding vector to its cross-lingual counterparts in other spaces, while preserving the functionalities of monolingual embeddings. We deploy three different techniques to represent cross-lingual transitions, namely axis calibration, translation vectors, and linear transformations, and derive five variants for MTransE using different loss functions. Our models can be trained on partially aligned graphs, where just a small portion of triples are aligned with their cross-lingual counterparts. The experiments on cross-lingual entity matching and triple-wise alignment verification show promising results, with some variants consistently outperforming others on different tasks. We also explore how MTransE preserves the key properties of its monolingual counterpart TransE.

AB  - Optimizing policies for real-time control of humanoid robots is a difficult task due to the continuous and stochastic nature of the state and action spaces. In this paper, we propose a learning procedure to train a predictive motion model and RFPI, a solver for continuousstate and action MDR We use the predictive model as a transition model to train policies for a robot soccer. Our method requires no external hardware, a small amount of human work and manages to outperform the expert policy used by our team Rhoban winning the last 2016 edition of the Robocup in kid-size soccer league. Moreover, the proposed method is able to adapt to nonholonomic robots more efficiently than the expert approach. Our results are confirmed by both simulations and real robot experiments.

AB  - The aim of this study was to model the energy flows for the production of different paddy rice cultivars in Golestan province of Iran using Cobb-Douglas (CD) model and artificial neural network (ANN). The studied energy inputs were human labor, agricultural machinery, diesel fuel, seed, biocide, chemical fertilizers, farmyard manure and electricity. The results indicated that the total energy consumption of paddy farms for high-yielding long grain (H-YLG) and high-grade long grain (H-GLG) paddy production were 108,392 and 89,835 MJha−1, respectively. Also, CD model and sensitivity analysis of energy inputs on paddy yield showed that the impacts of human labor, biocide and chemical fertilizers inputs on paddy yield were higher than the other inputs. The ANN results highlighted that the best model consisted of an input layer with eight inputs, one hidden layer with 25 neurons and an output layer (8–25–1 topology) for both H-YLG and H-GLG paddy cultivars. The results obtained from the comparative study of CD and ANN models for predicting the amount of H-GLG paddy production revealed that the ANN model with the determination coefficient (R2) of 0.99 and the root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.93 kgha1 estimated the outputs more accurately than the CD model. Besides, the ANN model estimated more accurate and precise outputs than CD model for predicting the production of H-YLG. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Lung delineation via dynamic 4D thoracic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is necessary for quantitative image analysis for studying pediatric respiratory diseases such as thoracic insufficiency syndrome (TIS). This task is very challenging because of the often-extreme malformations of the thorax in TIS, lack of signal from bone and connective tissues resulting in inadequate image quality, abnormal thoracic dynamics, and the inability of the patients to cooperate with the protocol needed to get good quality images. We propose an interactive fuzzy connectedness approach as a potential practical solution to this difficult problem. Manual segmentation is too labor intensive especially due to the 4D nature of the data and can lead to low repeatability of the segmentation results. Registration-based approaches are somewhat inefficient and may produce inaccurate results due to accumulated registration errors and inadequate boundary information. The proposed approach works in a manner resembling the Iterative Livewire tool but uses iterative relative fuzzy connectedness (IRFC) as the delineation engine. Seeds needed by IRFC are set manually and are propagated from slice-to-slice, decreasing the needed human labor, and then a fuzzy connectedness map is automatically calculated almost instantaneously. If the segmentation is acceptable, the user selects "next" slice. Otherwise, the seeds are refined and the process continues. Although human interaction is needed, an advantage of the method is the high level of efficient user-control on the process and non-necessity to refine the results. Dynamic MRI sequences from 5 pediatric TIS patients involving 39 3D spatial volumes are used to evaluate the proposed approach. The method is compared to two other IRFC strategies with a higher level of automation. The proposed method yields an overall true positive and false positive volume fraction of 0.91 and 0.03, respectively, and Hausdorff boundary distance of 2 mm. © 2017 SPIE.

AB  - IT services are extremely human labor intensive, and a key focus is to provide efficient services at low cost. Automation of repeatable IT tasks using software service agents that reduce human effort is therefore an important component of service management. A large fraction of the work done by IT service personnel involves troubleshooting of problems. However, the complexity of IT systems makes automated problem determination and resolution a challenging research problem. Using a database of prior customer problems and solutions, we build a system that extracts knowledge about different classes of problems arising in the IT infrastructure, mine problem linkages to recent system changes, and identify the resolution activities to mitigate problems. The system, at its core, uses data mining, machine learning, and natural language parsing techniques. By using extracted knowledge, one can (i) understand the kind of problems and the root causes affecting the IT infrastructure, (ii) proactively remediate the causes so that they no longer result in problems, and (iii) estimate the scope for automation for service management. In the future, a large cost differentiator for any IT company will often involve being able to build automated service agents from these technologies, which will result in a reduction in human effort. © 1957-2012 IBM.

AB  - Hazardous environments such as in industry sector with high chemical usage give high risks to the safety of workers. These risks can be reduced by designing robotic hand that is able to replace human works. For the industry purpose, the robotic hand needs to have a higher performance in accuracy, stability and consistency. However, the current robotic hand in industry is not flexible, which means it cannot be used for different tasks. Therefore, a multi-purpose robotic hand was developed. In this paper, the objectives of this research are to design and develop a PID controller for improving the performances of a robotic hand system. The experimental results prove that the PID controller shows good performances with the steady state error less than 0.11° for the input reference, 30° respectively. © 2017 Penerbit UTM Press.

AB  - Semi-supervised clustering seeks to augment traditional clustering methods by incorporating side information provided via human expertise in order to increase the semantic meaningfulness of the resulting clusters. However, most current methods are passive in the sense that the side information is provided beforehand and selected randomly. This may require a large number of constraints, some of which could be redundant, unnecessary, or even detrimental to the clustering results. Thus in order to scale such semi-supervised algorithms to larger problems it is desirable to pursue an active clustering method - i.e., an algorithm that maximizes the effectiveness of the available human labor by only requesting human input where it will have the greatest impact. Here, we propose a novel online framework for active semi-supervised spectral clustering that selects pairwise constraints as clustering proceeds, based on the principle of uncertainty reduction. Using a first-order Taylor expansion, we decompose the expected uncertainty reduction problem into a gradient and a step-scale, computed via an application of matrix perturbation theory and cluster-assignment entropy, respectively. The resulting model is used to estimate the uncertainty reduction potential of each sample in the dataset. We then present the human user with pairwise queries with respect to only the best candidate sample. We evaluate our method using three different image datasets (faces, leaves and dogs), a set of common UCI machine learning datasets and a gene dataset. The results validate our decomposition formulation and show that our method is consistently superior to existing state-of-the-art techniques, as well as being robust to noise and to unknown numbers of clusters. © 2016 IEEE.

AB  - Effective machine health monitoring systems are critical to modern manufacturing systems and industries. Among various machine health monitoring approaches, data-driven methods are gaining in popularity due to the development of advanced sensing and data analytic techniques. However, sensory data that is a kind of sequential data can not serve as direct meaningful representations for machine conditions due to its noise, varying length and irregular sampling. A majority of previous models focus on feature extraction/fusion methods that involve expensive human labor and high quality expert knowledge. With the development of deep learning methods in the last few years, representation learning from raw data has been redefined. Among deep learning models, Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs) are able to capture long-term dependencies and model sequential data. Therefore, LSTMs is able to work on the sensory data of machine condition. Here, the first study about a empirical evaluation of LSTMs-based machine health monitoring systems is presented. A real life tool wear test is introduced. Basic and deep LSTMs are designed to predict the actual tool wear based on raw sensory data. The experimental results have shown that our models, especially deep LSTMs, are able to outperform several state-of-arts baseline methods. © 2016 IEEE.

AB  - Industries utilize two-sided assembly lines for producing large-sized volume products such as cars and trucks. By employing robots, industries achieve a high level of automation in the assembly process. Robots help to replace human labor and execute tasks efficiently at each workstation in the assembly line. From the literature, it is concluded that not much work has been conducted on two two-sided robotic assembly line balancing problems. This article addresses the two-sided robotic assembly line balancing problem with the objective of minimizing the cycle time. A mixed-integer programming model of the proposed problem is developed which is solved by the CPLEX solver for small-sized problems. Due to the problems in non-polynomial - hard nature, a co-evolutionary particle swarm optimization algorithm is developed to solve it. The co-evolutionary particle swarm optimization utilizes local search on the global best individual to enhance intensification, modification of global best to emphasize exploration, and restart mechanism to escape from local optima. The performances of the proposed co-evolutionary particle swarm optimization are evaluated on the modified seven well-known two-sided assembly line balancing problems available in the literature. The proposed algorithm is compared with five other well-known metaheuristics, and computational and statistical results demonstrate that the proposed co-evolutionary particle swarm optimization outperforms most of the other metaheuristics for majority of the problems considered in the study. © The Author(s) 2016.

AB  - Inserting electronic components is a commonly-seen step in a manufacturing process of electronic products. Previously it was done by human operators. As long as the shortage of human labor advents, the insertion process of electronic components has been replaced by robots. Because pins of electronic components are usually curved and tilted from piece to piece, it becomes difficult to insert them onto electrical boards by robots. Thus, this paper presents an intelligent insertion system that uses the Fuzzy c-means (FCM) and the hierarchical support vector machines (SVM) to find an appropriate robotic insertion position and orientation by images of transformer pins. The experiments validated the proposed method using a 6-DOF robot arm. The result showed that the accuracy rate of the hierarchical SVMs on five hundred testing transformers is up to 90%. © 2016 IEEE.

AB  - Abnormality detection is useful in reducing the amount of data to be processed manually by directing attention to the specific portion of data. However, selections of suitable features are important for the success of an abnormality detection system. Designing and selecting appropriate features are time-consuming, requires expensive domain knowledge and human labor. Further, it is very challenging to represent high-level concepts of abnormality in terms of raw input. Most of the existing abnormality detection system use handcrafted feature detector and are based on shallow architecture. In this work, we explore Deep Belief Network for abnormality detection and simultaneously, compared the performance of classic neural network in terms of features learned and accuracy of detecting the abnormality. Further, we explore the set of features learn by each layer of the deep architecture. We also provide a simple and fast mechanism to visualize the feature at the higher layer. Further, the effect of different activation function on abnormality detection is also compared. We observed that deep learning based approach can be used for detecting an abnormality. It has better performance compare to classical neural network in separating distinct as well as almost similar data. © 2016 ACM.

AB  - In the studies of intelligent fault diagnosis of machines, lots of effort goes into designing effective feature extraction algorithms. Such processes would consume plenty of human labor, especially when dealing with massive vibration signals. So it is interesting to automatically extract features using machine learning techniques, instead of manually extracting them. To deal with the problem, this paper presents a new automatic feature extraction method of machines. The proposed method first learns features from the vibration signals by K-means, and then maps the learned features into a salient low-dimensional feature space using t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE). Through the feature extraction results of a bearing dataset, it is verified that the proposed method is able to effectively learn the features from the raw vibration signals and is superior to the manual features like time-domain features and wavelet features. Therefore, the proposed method has potential to be a tool in the automatic data mining of intelligent fault diagnosis. © 2016 IEEE.

AB  - Intelligent fault diagnosis is a promising tool to deal with mechanical big data due to its ability in rapidly and efficiently processing collected signals and providing accurate diagnosis results. In traditional intelligent diagnosis methods, however, the features are manually extracted depending on prior knowledge and diagnostic expertise. Such processes take advantage of human ingenuity but are time-consuming and labor-intensive. Inspired by the idea of unsupervised feature learning that uses artificial intelligence techniques to learn features from raw data, a two-stage learning method is proposed for intelligent diagnosis of machines. In the first learning stage of the method, sparse filtering, an unsupervised two-layer neural network, is used to directly learn features from mechanical vibration signals. In the second stage, softmax regression is employed to classify the health conditions based on the learned features. The proposed method is validated by a motor bearing dataset and a locomotive bearing dataset, respectively. The results show that the proposed method obtains fairly high diagnosis accuracies and is superior to the existing methods for the motor bearing dataset. Because of learning features adaptively, the proposed method reduces the need of human labor and makes intelligent fault diagnosis handle big data more easily. © 2016 IEEE.

AB  - Background: The throughput of electrophysiological recording is growing rapidly, allowing thousands of simultaneous channels, and there is a growing variety of spike sorting algorithms designed to extract neural firing events from such data. This creates an urgent need for standardized, automatic evaluation of the quality of neural units output by such algorithms. New method: We introduce a suite of validation metrics that assess the credibility of a given automatic spike sorting algorithm applied to a given dataset. By rerunning the spike sorter two or more times, the metrics measure stability under various perturbations consistent with variations in the data itself, making no assumptions about the internal workings of the algorithm, and minimal assumptions about the noise. Results: We illustrate the new metrics on standard sorting algorithms applied to both in vivo and ex vivo recordings, including a time series with overlapping spikes. We compare the metrics to existing quality measures, and to ground-truth accuracy in simulated time series. We provide a software implementation. Comparison with existing methods: Metrics have until now relied on ground-truth, simulated data, internal algorithm variables (e.g. cluster separation), or refractory violations. By contrast, by standardizing the interface, our metrics assess the reliability of any automatic algorithm without reference to internal variables (e.g. feature space) or physiological criteria. Conclusions: Stability is a prerequisite for reproducibility of results. Such metrics could reduce the significant human labor currently spent on validation, and should form an essential part of large-scale automated spike sorting and systematic benchmarking of algorithms. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In classification problems, many different active learning techniques are often adopted to find the most informative samples for labeling in order to save human labors. Among them, active learning support vector machine (SVM) is one of the most representative approaches, in which model parameter is usually set as a fixed default value during the whole learning process. Note that model parameter is closely related to the training set. Hence dynamic parameter is desirable to make a satisfactory learning performance. To target this issue, we proposed a novel algorithm, called active learning SVM with regularization path, which can fit the entire solution path of SVM for every value of model parameters. In this algorithm, we first traced the entire solution path of the current classifier to find a series of candidate model parameters, and then used unlabeled samples to select the best model parameter. Besides, in the initial phase of training, we constructed a training sample sets by using an improved K-medoids cluster algorithm. Experimental results conducted from real-world data sets showed the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm for image classification problems. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Service units used in precision agriculture are able to improve processes such as harvesting, sowing, agrochemical application, and manure spreading. This two-part work presents, a path tracking controller based on an algebraic approach for an articulated service unit, suitable for embedded applications, and its implementation to a hierarchical navigation strategy to aid a manual harvesting process. The path tracking controller approach can be scaled to several trailers attached to the service unit. For harvesting, the service unit drives within an olive grove environment following the previously developed path and a trailer is used as a mobile hopper where olives, collected by human labour, are deposited. The service unit also registers and geo-references the amount of olives (mass) collected for the subsequent creation of yield maps. The developed navigation strategy improved the time associated with harvesting olives by approximately 42-45%. The mathematical formulation of the problem, some real time experimental results, the creation of a yield map and the statistical analysis that validated the method are included. © 2015 IAgrE.

AB  - Topic modeling is nowadays widely used in text archive analytics, to find significant topics in news articles and important aspects of product comments available on the Internet. While statistical approaches, e.g. Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and its variants, are effective on building topic models on long texts, it remains difficult to identify meaningful topics over short texts, e.g. news titles and social-media messages. With the emergence and prosperity of crowdsourcing platforms, it becomes possible and easier for analytical systems to incorporate human intelligence into text analytics. Different from traditional active learning techniques, the combination of crowdsourcing and machine learning poses new challenges on the design of simple tasks for non-experts to finish in seconds. In this paper, we design a new topic modeling technique, fully exploiting the basic intuitions of humans on short text reading. By requesting human labors to subjectively measure the similarity between short text pairs, the accuracy of the topic modeling algorithms could be greatly enhanced, regardless of the prior used in the graphical model. We present well-designed short text pair selection strategies for crowdsourcing and provide analysis on the convergence property of the inference algorithm. Empirical studies show that our proposed approaches improve the result topics on English tweets and Chinese microblogs, by requesting only a small number of labels from crowd. © 2016 X. Yang, S.

AB  - Relation extraction, which learns semantic relations of concept pairs from text, is an approach for mining common-sense knowledge. This paper investigates an approach for relation extraction, which helps expand a commonsense knowledge base with little labor work. We proposed a framework that learns new pairs from Chinese corpora by adopting concept pairs in Chinese commonsense knowledge base as seeds. Multiple instance learning is utilized as the learning algorithm for predicting relation for unseen pairs. The performance of our system could be improved by learning multiple iterations. The results in each iteration are manually evaluated and processed to next iteration as seeds. Our experiments extracted new pairs for relations "AtLocation", "CapableOf', and "HasProperty". This study showed that new pairs could be extracted from text without huge humans work. Copyright © 2016, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

AB  - The aim of this paper is to present conceptual resources that address social robotics from a philosophical, social, and economic perspective. Since social robotics is an emerging and potentially high-impact area, it is necessary to consider the ethics and philosophy of social robotics and its potential impact on society. Philosophical, economic, and ethical issues are addressed first generally, revealing that social robotics is most-centrally a situation of humanmachine collaboration. Second, economic issues are examined more specifically, positing that social robotics might figure prominently in both an automation economy that focuses on reduced requirements for human labor and an abundance economy that targets improved human quality of life. The stakes of social robotics are high and could mean both quantitative and qualitative benefits, and take advantage of the close connection with humans to help negotiate and buffer interactions between humans and a world with an increasing and expanding presence of technology. © Springer International Publishing AG 2016.

AB  - Designing a robust controller for uncertain multi input-multi output (MIMO) nonlinear dynamical system (e.g., robot manipulator) can be a challenging work in this research. Robot manipulators are set of links which connected by joints, they are multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO), nonlinear, time variant, uncertain dynamic systems and are developed either to replace human work in many fields such as in industrial or in the manufacturing. According to the dynamic formulation of robot manipulators, they are uncertain and have strong coupling effects between joints. To solve this challenge, sliding mode controller is selected since it is robust, stable and it works very well in certain and fairly uncertain condition. Although this controller works incredibly efficient, but still, it has two important challenges, namely the high frequency chattering and working in uncertain situation. To reduce the chattering with respect to stability and robustness; linear controller is added to discontinuous (switching) part of sliding mode controller. In this methodology linear controller is used in parallel with discontinuous part to reduce the role of sliding surface slope and switching (sign) function. To modify chattering free sliding mode controller in uncertain situation PID like fuzzy logic theory is recommended in estimating the robot manipulator 's nonlinear dynamic formulation and on-line tuning sliding surface slope.As a result, this controller improves the stability and robustness, reduces the chattering as well and reduces the level of energy due to the torque performance as well. © International Science Press.

AB  - There are three defects for providing human-labor customer services in e-commerce operations: high costs of human labors, staff turnover, and lack of service quality assurance. Breakthroughs made in artificial intelligence, natural language processing and related fields make it possible to replace human labors with online artificial intelligent robots to provide the e-commerce customer service, which indicates the online robots are the future of e-commerce customer services. However, most of the current robots are designed to reply with knowledge matching the key words in question sentences from the database, rarely involving in research on customer intentions that are key factors influencing user experience and online sales. In this research, an intention recognizing model was proposed to obtain intentions of e-commerce consumers by computing the strengths of candidate intention nodes in the intention graph, which was used to describe relations between different goods that could be the intentional targets of e-commerce consumers. The proposed robot was constructed based on the intention recognizing model to identify intentions of consumers and use the located knowledge combined with the AIML based sentence composition template to produce the response sentences for consumers. At last, the proposed robot was evaluated using F3 and ROUGE metrics by comparing with a keyword matching robot. And the evaluation results proved the validity of the proposed robot.

AB  - As for machine parts with irregular shaped face edges, they are usually chamfered by human labor or chamfering machines which grind along the irregular edges with positon control. Especially some machine parts may have multiple space plane to be chamfered, which also need certain high chamfering quality. To solve this problem, a new machine part chamfering robot is designed, which is based on force compensation control. The chamfering robot mainly consists of vertical axis (Y-Axis), horizontal axis (X-Axis), compensation axis and rotation axis. X-Y table conducts interpolation motion to track the work piece. Meanwhile, the rotation axis, fixing with work piece, can rotate to meet the demand of multiple space contour processing. And the key component is the compensation axis (C-Axis) which has been equipped with a force sensor along the axis. So the compensation axis can receive real time feedback force signal. And according to the preliminary simulation, the friction compensation which is based on the exponential friction model is added to reflect and approximate the real axial cutting force to realize constant force processing while other double axes simultaneously motion to achieve trajectory tracking. Focused on PID control strategy, the control system of the compensation axis and X-Y table, as well as the X-Y-C axes of chamfering robot is analyzed. Furthermore the simulation models are respectively built in this paper. Finally simulation results show that by using force compensation control, the machine part chamfering robot can process with good quality and high efficiency. © 2015 IEEE.

AB  - Objective: Drug named entity recognition (NER) is a critical step for complex biomedical NLP tasks such as the extraction of pharmacogenomic, pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic parameters. Large quantities of high quality training data are almost always a prerequisite for employing supervised machine-learning techniques to achieve high classification performance. However, the human labour needed to produce and maintain such resources is a significant limitation. In this study, we improve the performance of drug NER without relying exclusively on manual annotations. Methods: We perform drug NER using either a small gold-standard corpus (120 abstracts) or no corpus at all. In our approach, we develop a voting system to combine a number of heterogeneous models, based on dictionary knowledge, gold-standard corpora and silver annotations, to enhance performance. To improve recall, we employed genetic programming to evolve 11 regular-expression patterns that capture common drug suffixes and used them as an extra means for recognition. Materials: Our approach uses a dictionary of drug names, i.e. DrugBank, a small manually annotated corpus, i.e. the pharmacokinetic corpus, and a part of the UKPMC database, as raw biomedical text. Gold-standard and silver annotated data are used to train maximum entropy and multinomial logistic regression classifiers. Results: Aggregating drug NER methods, based on gold-standard annotations, dictionary knowledge and patterns, improved the performance on models trained on gold-standard annotations, only, achieving a maximum F-score of 95%. In addition, combining models trained on silver annotations, dictionary knowledge and patterns are shown to achieve comparable performance to models trained exclusively on gold-standard data. The main reason appears to be the morphological similarities shared among drug names. Conclusion: We conclude that gold-standard data are not a hard requirement for drug NER. Combining heterogeneous models build on dictionary knowledge can achieve similar or comparable classification performance with that of the best performing model trained on gold-standard annotations. © 2015 The Authors.

AB  - Welding manufacturing is a commonly used process in a variety of industries and countries. Nowadays, in industrially advanced countries, like the US and European countries, increasing the robotic and mechanized level of the welding production line and decreasing human labor is the trend in order to lower production costs. In the newly industrialized countries, manual welding is still widely employed. The increasing quality requirements and costs call for less repair work and manufacturing waste from manual welding workshops and factories in the future. To understanding how different human, social, and performance factors during manual welding production influence the welding quality and cost is especially significant to the companies in the newly industrialized countries. The Gephi software provides a possible visualization environment to observe the relationships among the different factors in welding manufacturing processes. By using the information by interviews, field visits, and discussions in the case companies, the Gephi software can reveal the relationships among the factors. The aim of this study is to find the direct visual image of the relationships among the different factors and five welding works. The result provides the foundation for future detailed analyses and it contributes to improve the working environment and management strategy in welding industries. © 2015 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l. -All rights reserved

AB  - This paper discusses the concept of “human disenhancement”, i.e. the worsening of human individual abilities and expectations through technology. The goal is provoking ethical reflection on technological innovation outside the biomedical realm, in particular the substitution of human work with computer-driven automation. According to some widely accepted economic theories, automatization and computerization are responsible for the disappearance of many middle-class jobs. I argue that, if that is the case, a technological innovation can be a cause of “human disenhancement”, globally, and all things considered, even when the local and immediate effect of that technology is to increase the demand of more sophisticated human skills than the ones they substitute. The conclusion is that current innovations in the ICT sector are objectionable from a moral point of view, because they disenhance more people than they enhance. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - In aggressive environments for humans, such as those present in the offshore industry, the main alternative is to replace human labor by remotely controlled robots, and some cases completely autonomous robots. The environment affects directly on robots tasks. When a robot works in a structured environment, its automation is easier since the environment can be modeled by dynamics equations. However if the environment is non-structured this modeling is quite difficult and presents a high computational effort. To overcome this difficult, over the years series elastic actuator (SEA) has been applied in non-structured environments. Actuators of the mechanical systems are always rigidly connected to the load to be moved. This can be observed in the hydraulic systems of agricultural, highway construction and mining equipment and in elevation and cargo transportation, among others. Unlike rigid actuators, a SEA contains an elastic element in series with the mechanical energy source. Such an elastic element gives SEA's several unique properties compared to rigid actuators, including tolerance to impact loads, low mechanical output impedance, passive mechanical energy storage, and increased peak power output. However it is not trivial to select the correct spring for the system. The spring has to be able to support the loads, but the spring cannot be too stiff, otherwise system impedance will be high. Iterative methods are needed to select the spring, which fits in impedance and bandwidth parameters. The resonance frequency is another issue for SEAs. This paper describes an entire digital prototyping of a linear serial elastic hydraulic actuator. It is done a digital prototyping of a tubular actuator design, which encapsulates the mechanical and electrical components and sensors. The digital prototype dimensions, mass and inertia properties are used to build the dynamic model for simulations and implementation of a controller. Moreover the methodology adopted results in a good response actuator with a compact and high force design. © 2015, IFAG.

AB  - Nursing homes and long-term care institutions often need technological assistance because of the high ratio of low-functioning residents coupled with a shortage of caregivers. To explore the potential uses of emerging robotic technologies in nursing homes, we apply Forlizzi's concept of the product ecology and a user-centered design approach involving field observations and focus groups to understand what kind of robot design would be suitable for the nursing home context. Our results show that instead of robots replacing human labor, nursing home staff prefer robot assistants who fit into their work process. We also learned the most appropriate functions for robots in nursing homes were helping with minor tasks and encouraging social interaction among residents. Our study was performed in two nursing homes in Taiwan. © 2014 IEEE.

AB  - Many experts believe that in the coming decades, artificial intelligence will change, and perhaps significantly reduce, the demand for human labor in the economy, but there remains much uncertainty about the accuracy of this claim and what to do about it. This paper identifies several ways in which the artificial intelligence community can help society to anticipate and shape such outcomes in a socially beneficial direction. First, different technical aspirations for the field of AI may be associated with different social outcomes, increasing the stakes of decisions made in the AI community. Second, the extent of researchers' efforts to apply AI to different social and economic domains will influence the distribution of cognition between humans and machines in those domains. Third, the AI community can play a key role in initiating a more nuanced and inclusive public discussion of the social and economic possibilities afforded by AI technologies. To pave the way for such dialogue, we suggest a line of research aimed at better understanding the nature, pace, and drivers of progress in AI in order to more effectively anticipate and shape AI's role in society. © 2015, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

AB  - At present, the application of pipelines in industries is becoming more severe. The application is not limited for home application only but it can stretch up to thousands of kilometers across countries. Pipelines are used to transport water, sewage, flammable liquid, high pressure gasses and oil. In order to ensure efficient pipelines performance, the pipelines need to undergo routine monitoring, maintenance and repairing activities. However, due to the nature of pipelines that are long, interconnected, and sometimes buried underground or far beneath the sea make it hard to accomplish the tasks. Relying on human labor for the cleaning and maintenance process is not efficient, not safe and not economical. Therefore, there is a strong demand for a robot that can help the cleaning and repairing process in the pipelines. The main aim of this research is to produce an in-pipe robot. This paper will specifically discuss about the development of hardware and software of track wheel for in-pipe robot application. The Caterpillar concept has been chosen to be considered for further development. The Caterpillar that is equipped with special made track wheel is able to move and also climb in pipelines. The scope of this project is limited to 14" inner diameter of UPVC pipe. The development of the wheel track has followed a systematic engineering design process. Experiments have been conducted to validate the software and hardware. As a result, the developed track wheel successfully climbed up to 300 without skidding or slipping. Consequently, the designed track wheel can be considered to be applied as locomotion of the in-pipe robot. The track wheel can be used to move, climb and maneuver the robot in the pipeline smoothly. © 2015 The Authors.

AB  - Rice is an important crop utilized as a staple food in many parts of the world and particularly of importance in Asia. The process to grow rice is very human labor intensive. Much of the difficult labor of rice production can be automated with intelligent and robotic platforms. We propose an intelligent agent which can use sensors to automate the process of distinguishing between rice and weeds, so that a robot can cultivate fields. This paper describes a feature-based learning approach to automatically identify and distinguish weeds from rice plants. A Harris Corner Detection algorithm is firstly applied to find the points of interests such as the tips of leaf and the rice ear, secondly, multiple features for each points surrounding area are extracted to feed into a machine learning algorithm to discriminate weed from rice, last but not least, a clustering algorithm is used for noise removal based on the points position and density. Evaluation performed on images downloaded from internet yielded very promising classification result. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.

AB  - A format for work specification is developed. It is a format to specify and annotate activity performed by people. Through this format, people may specify the target, objective, and intended results of an activity. The format improves the completeness of specification by using a predefined set of elements. In addition, it improves understanding through efficient access to required knowledge. Moreover, it improves correctness of specification by consistency and dependency checking. In this paper, we introduce the definition of the work, contents of the format, description method of the contents and candidate icons of language to specify it. In addition, to demonstrate and evaluate the format, an example specification of agriculture work is presented. © 2014 IEEE.

AB  - With the maturity of the industrial robotic technology, robotic cells are gradually regarded as a kind of stand equipment to replace human work in every walk of life. How to obtain the maximum or approximate maximum throughput in a robotic cell is always the highlighted goal, especially in the rapid growing 3C industry market. In this paper, the objective is to get a 1-unit cycle sequence of robot actions that approximately minimizes the cycle time to produce a part and maximizes the throughput by using a new hybrid algorithm in the robotic cell with a dual-gripper robot. In this algorithm, different constrains are considered during computing the cycle time, including free/non-free process, allowed time window. The resulting diagrams provide very intuitive insights into the accuracy of the hybrid algorithm compared with the exact algorithm. Additional 100 simulation results prove the effectiveness of the hybrid algorithm, with a solid performance to achieve the maximum productivity of robotic cell. © 2014 IEEE.

AB  - Crowd-sourcing has become a popular means of acquiring labeled data for many tasks where humans are more accurate than computers, such as image tagging, entity resolution, and sentiment analysis. However, due to the time and cost of human labor, solutions that rely solely on crowd-sourcing are o?en limited to small datasets (i.e., a few thousand items). This paper proposes algorithms for integrating machine learning into crowd-sourced databases in order to combine the accuracy of human labeling with the speed and coste ?ectiveness of machine learning classifiers. By using active learning as our optimization strategy for labeling tasks in crowd-sourced databases, we can minimize the number of questions asked to the crowd, allowing crowd-sourced applications to scale (i.e., labelmuch larger datasets at lower costs). Designing active learning algorithms for a crowd-sourced database posesmany practical challenges: such algorithms need to be generic, scalable, and easy to use, even for practitioners who are notmachine learning experts. We draw on the theory of nonparametric bootstrap to design, to the best of our knowledge, the first active learning algorithms that meet all these requirements. Our results, on 3 real-world datasets collected with AmazonsMechanical Turk, and on UCI datasets, show that our methods on average ask 1-2 orders of magnitude fewer questions than the baseline, and 4.5-44× fewer than existing active learning algorithms. © 2014 VLDB Endowment 2150-8097/14/10.

AB  - The needs of molecular diagnostic laboratories that perform both Food and Drug Administration–cleared as well as laboratory-developed tests are usually not met on a single analytical platform. Furthermore, little information is available about the direct impact of molecular automation on labor costs and efficiency in clinical laboratories. We performed a process impact analysis from time and motion studies of a novel molecular diagnostic robotic system designed to automate sample preparation, extraction, and analysis. All 27 preanalytical tasks were quantified for the amount of time spent preparing 24 specimens for analysis. These steps were completed in 899 s (14 min, 59 s) followed by 7887 s (131 min, 27 s) of instrument operation independent of operator control (walk-away time). Postanalytical results evaluation required 1 min per specimen. The instrument automatically extracted the nucleic acid from the specimen, added the eluted DNA to the amplification reagents, and performed the analysis. Only 12% of the total instrument operations required relatively unskilled human labor. Thus, the availability of automated molecular diagnostic instruments will facilitate the expansion of molecular testing in the clinical laboratory because they reduce operator costs with respect to time and complexity of the tasks they are asked to perform. © 2014 Society for Laboratory Automation and Screening.

AB  - In the past few years the need for more flexibility in industrial production has implied a growing attention towards scenarios where humans work directly in touch with robots. In order to allow safe human-robot interaction, a methodology to evaluate the severity of an impact between a human worker and an industrial robot, based on related work on injury knowledge in human-robot contacts and relying on information coming from different exteroceptive sensors, has been developed in this paper. On the basis of this severity evaluation, the robot controller enforces a suitable safety-oriented strategy, ranging from on-path speed reduction to task-consistent evasive motion and protective stop. The safety evaluation methodology has been implemented in a dedicated software component, integrated with a video surveillance system and with the real time robot controller to obtain a complete HW/SW architecture named 'Safety Controller'. The system has been validated on an ABB IRB140 robot. © 2014 IEEE.

AB  - Semi-supervised learning and active learning are important techniques to build more accurate model while labeled data are scarce. The objective of this paper is combining both to effectively relieve user labor for multi-class annotation. We propose a novel graph-based active semi-supervised learning framework which aim at efficiently learning a multi-class model with minimal human labor. In particular, we propose Minimize Expected Global Uncertainty algorithm to actively select examples (for labels), which naturally integrates with the probabilistic results of graph-based semi-supervised learning. Meanwhile, we update the model incrementally by decomposed formulation while the new example are incorporated for training, which only has the time complexity of O(n), compared to the original re-training of O(n3). Extensive evaluations over three real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed method has the superior performance comparing with the baselines and the capability to efficiently build more accurate model with fractional human labor. © 2014 IEEE.

AB  - Service robots are robots that are intended to perform tasks normally done by humans in an environment in which humans work as well. However, they are neither required to accomplish these tasks in the same way as humans nor need to look like a human being. A tele-operated robot is controlled from a distance (near or far) by a human operator. The human operator can control the robot either by joysticks or by instructions. This paper describes the design and experiment results of a tele-operated service robot, ROSE (Remotely Operated SErvice robot) [1]. ROSE was developed to perform home-care tasks. Experiments with ROSE have shown this is feasible. ROSE was controlled from a distance (8 km) by care givers to perform small tasks for elderly. The design of ROSE can be used to develop service robots for other domains, e.g. to perform security tasks, building maintenance and construction. © 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This paper presents a method to compose half-diminished reality images for remote control robots using three RGB-D sensors. Robots are designed to perform the work of humans during a disaster response to reduce secondary disasters. In these case, a operator controls the robot with the aid of images from a mounted camera. However, operating efficiency decreases significantly when the robot arm occludes target work objects in those images. Recently, the Half-Diminished Reality technique has been proposed in the field of computer vision. This technique is used for seeing through foreground objects and viewing occluded backgrounds. Accordingly, composing half-diminished reality images can enable the operator to see the target work objects occluded by the robot arm in only one image, which results in increased the operating efficiency. © 2014 IEEE.

AB  - Human-scale mobile robots with arms have the potential to assist people with a variety of tasks. We present a proof-of-concept system that has enabled a person with severe quadriplegia named Henry Evans to shave himself in his own home using a general purpose mobile manipulator (PR2 from Willow Garage). The robot primarily provides assistance by holding a tool (e.g., an electric shaver) at user-specified locations around the user's head, while he/she moves his/her head against it. If the robot detects forces inappropriate for the task (e.g., shaving), it withdraws the tool. The robot also holds a mirror with its other arm, so that the user can see what he/she is doing. For all aspects of the task, the robot and the human work together. The robot uses a series of distinct semi-autonomous subsystems during the task to navigate to poses next to the wheelchair, attain initial arm configurations, register a 3D model of the person's head, move the tool to coarse semantically-labeled tool poses (e.g, 'Cheek'), and finely position the tool via incremental movements. Notably, while moving the tool near the user's head, the robot uses an ellipsoidal coordinate system attached to the 3D head model. In addition to describing the complete robotic system, we report results from Henry Evans using it to shave both sides of his face while sitting in his wheelchair at home. He found the process to be long (54 minutes) and the interface unintuitive. Yet, he also found the system to be comfortable to use, felt safe while using it, was satisfied with it, and preferred it to a human caregiver. © 2014 IEEE.

AB  - Farming consumes considerable energy, natural resources and intensive human labor. Robotic assisted farmer can make farming activities more precise and more efficient; particularly it may remedy shortage of farmers in the future. A planter is a mechanism which performs precision seeding. Design of a planter in the optimum manner that needs minimum draft force when attached to a mobile robot, was the main objective of this work. A planter was developed, fabricated and tested in the course of a research project. The main motivation for this research is the fact that a mobile robot, is an electric powered vehicle with limited power and pulling force. Thus, a customized planter with a customized connection mechanism should be designed that can be pulled by mobile robot. The developed planter should have the same efficiency as the existing planters in seeding. To study the interaction between soil engagement tool (disc coulter) and soil, experiments were performed in the Linear Soil Bin. Different parameters of the disc coulter were changed and the draft force, vertical force and side force were measured. The results of the experiments were used to find the optimum parameters of the disc that caused minimum draft force. A novel planter was designed and fabricated; it was attached to a mobile robot, and field tested. Tests performed in outdoor and indoor settings showed satisfactory results. Draft force developed on the planter was close to analytical value and performance of the planter in other aspects was as expected. Copyright © 2014 by ASME.

AB  - Nursing homes and long-term care institutions often need technological assistance because of the high ratio of low-functioning residents coupled with a shortage of caregivers. To explore the potential uses of emerging robotic technologies in nursing homes, we apply Forlizzi's concept of the product ecology and a user-centered design approach involving field study and focus groups to understand what kind of robot design would be suitable in the nursing home context. Our preliminary results show that instead of a robot which completely replaces human labor, nursing home staff prefer robot assistants who fit into their working process. We also learned the most appropriate functions for robots in nursing homes were helping with minor tasks and encouraging social interaction among residents. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Recently, a robot-based construction automation (RCA) project was finished in Korea, whose purpose was to employ a robotic system instead of human labor in steel beam assembly tasks. In that research, a robotic beam assembly (RBA) system was developed to execute a beam assembly task. A field application using the RBA system at an actual construction site was completed. Because a human operator had to board the cabin and manipulate the system in the air, causing possible safety problems, a teleoperation system was developed and is the subject of this paper. To evaluate the performance of the teleoperation system, a pointing task experiment based on Fitts' law was conducted to determine whether it obeyed speed-accuracy tradeoff rules. Results are discussed and an overview of the actual bolting test using the teleoperation system is presented here. Finally, conclusions are drawn about the feasibility of implementing an RBA system with teleoperation in actual building construction applications. © 2013 Korean Society for Precision Engineering and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to develop an automated disassembly cell that is flexible and robust to the physical variations of a product. In this way it is capable of dealing with any model of product, regardless of the level of detail in the supplied information. Design/methodology/approach - The concept of cognitive robotics is used to replicate human level expertise in terms of perception and decision making. As a result, difficulties with respect to the uncertainties and variations of the product in the disassembly process are resolved. Findings - Cognitive functions, namely reasoning and execution monitoring, can be used in basic behaviour control to address problems in variations of the disassembly process due to variations in the product's structure particularly across different models of the product. Research limitations/implications - The paper provides a practical approach to formulating the disassembly domain and behaviour control of the cognitive robotic agent via a high-level logical programming language that combines domain-specific heuristic knowledge with search to deal with variations in products and uncertainties that arise during the disassembly process. Practical implications - Full disassembly automation that is flexible and robust to the uncertainties that may arise potentially replaces human labour in a difficult and hazardous task. Consequently, the disassembly process will be more economically feasible, especially in developed countries. Originality/value - The paper provides a practical approach to the basic cognitive functions that replicate the human expert's behaviour to the disassembly cell. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - Telerobotics actually result from the merger of two originally separate areas that are teleoperation and robotics. Indeed, autonomous robotics is not yet fully developed, the robot must now be operated remotely by a human operator. We must therefore take into account the principles developed in teleoperation. However, as the robot can perform basic tasks independently, it is called telerobotics rather than teleoperation. Telerobotics has applications wherever man has difficulty working directly (hostile environment, too far or too small places) and the tasks are sufficiently complex or unpredictable to be an obstacle to full automation. The main condition for the development of telerobotics is the ability to compete with the direct intervention of humans or the use of an automated highly specialized. In the first case, the advantage of telerobotics is firstly the replacement of human labor painful or dangerous by another, more secure and more comfortable. In the second case, we must show the interest of a material more versatile than the automatic system dedicated to the proposed application. © 2013 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l.- All rights reserved.

AB  - Disasters are increased in number. No matter what the cause of the disaster is human or natural, the consequence is always hard and takes long time to deal with if only human labor is used. Robotic systems are used more and more in search and rescue mission to shorten the time as well as reduce the danger for human. Mobile robot system faced difficulties of uncertainties in sensor system, unstructured environments, or lack adaptive ability to situation and dynamic environments. This paper proposed a system utilized mobile robot with aid from aerial imaging system to assist its intelligent control system. System is autonomous control to process the environment for search and rescue mission. The joint operation achieved the detection and avoidance of obstacles with different features to guide ground robot to target. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - In today's scenario, automation is being given high priorities as it requires less human labour and is faster. With this in context, a clinical batch analyzer can be automated to perform various tests with a higher accuracy and efficiency. Generally, a patient sample is reacted with proportionate amount of reagent in a reaction cell to perform a required test and then a new setup is used for next test. So a design with three robotics arms and a batch analyzer plate can be used to perform the mentioned operation. The two of the three arms will be operating for transferring the samples to the reaction cell present in the batch plate and the third for ensuring the mixing of the fluids with each other and transferring the content to the micro flow cell where the test results can be readout. This automation of the batch analyzer will reduce the amount of time taken to complete the entire process but also increase the efficiency of test results. The system proposed can be used to perform 38 different types of tests for 32 different patients. © 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The goal of this paper is to apply graph cut (GC) theory to the classification of hyperspectral remote sensing images. The task is formulated as a labeling problem on Markov random field (MRF) constructed on the image grid, and GC algorithm is employed to solve this task. In general, a large number of user interactive strikes are necessary to obtain satisfactory segmentation results. Due to the spatial variability of spectral signatures, however, hyperspectral remote sensing images often contain many tiny regions. Labeling all these tiny regions usually needs expensive human labor. To overcome this difficulty, a pixelwise fuzzy classification based on support vector machine (SVM) is first applied. As a result, only pixels with high probabilities are preserved as labeled ones. This generates a pseudouser strike map. This map is then employed for GC to evaluate the truthful likelihoods of class labels and propagate them to the MRF. To evaluate the robustness of our method, we have tested our method on both large and small training sets. Additionally, comparisons are made between the results of SVM, SVM with stacking neighboring vectors, SVM with morphological preprocessing, extraction and classification of homogeneous objects, and our method. Comparative experimental results demonstrate the validity of our method. © 1980-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Background: As there is a shortage of scrub nurses in many hospitals, automatic surgical tool exchanging mechanism without human labour has been studied. Minimally invasive robotic surgeries (MIRS) also require scrub nurses. A surgical tool loading mechanism without a scrub nurse's assistance for MIRS is proposed. Many researchers have developed minimally invasive surgical instruments with a wrist joint that can be movable inside the abdomen. However, implementation of a distal rolling joint on a gripper is rare. Methods: To implement surgical tool exchanging without a scrub nurse's assistance, a slave manipulator and a tool loader were developed to load and unload a surgical tool unit. A surgical tool unit with a roll-pitch-roll wrist was developed. Several experiments were performed to validate the effectiveness of the slave manipulator and the surgical tool unit. Results: The slave manipulator and the tool loader were able to successfully unload and load the surgical tool unit without human assistance. The total duration of unloading and loading the surgical tool unit was 97s. Motion tracking experiments of the distal rolling joint were performed. The maximum positioning error of the step input response was 2°. Conclusions: The advantage of the proposed slave manipulator and tool loader is that other robotic systems or human labour are not needed for surgical tool loading. The feasibility of the distal rolling joint in MIS is verified. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - These days, agricultural work still involves demanding and exhausting duties. The application of autonomous robots is a possible way to support human labor in the field. By adapting the robots to several tasks, like harvesting or cultivation of different types of crop, costs can be reduced while the flexibility of the system is increased. Thus, in this paper several concepts of modular agricultural manipulators for sweet-pepper, apples, and grapes are presented and discussed. In order to achieve dexterous manipulation and to be able to avoid obstacles, redundant robots are investigated. Kinematic as well as dynamic simulation models are applied for system design and evaluation. Finally, the developed manipulator and first control results are introduced. Both, simulations and measurements, demonstrate the principal suitability of the system. © 2012 IEEE.

AB  - In this paper, adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) was used to predict the grain yield of irrigated wheat in Abyek town of Ghazvin province, Iran. Due to large number of inputs (eight inputs) for ANFIS, the input vector was clustered into two groups and two networks were trained. Inputs for ANFIS 1 were diesel fuel, fertilizer and electricity energies and for ANFIS 2 were human labor, machinery, chemicals, water for irrigation and seed energies. The RMSE and R2 values were found 0.013 and 0.996 for ANFIS 1 and 0.018 and 0.992 for ANFIS 2, respectively. These results showed that ANFIS 1 and ANFIS 2 could well predict the yield. Finally, the predicted values of the two networks were used as inputs to the third ANFIS. The results indicated that the energy inputs in ANFIS 1 have a greater impact on the final yield production than other energy inputs. Also, the RMSE and R2 values for ANFIS 3 were 0.013 and 0.996, respectively. These results showed that ANFIS 1 and the combined network (ANFIS 3) could both predict the grain yield with good accuracy. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this article, the RObject concept is first introduced. This is followed by a survey of applicable energy scavenging technologies. Energy is a key issue for the large scale deployment of robotics in daily life, as recharging the batteries places a considerable burden on the end-user and is a waste of energy which has an overall negative impact on the limited resources of our planet. We show how the energy obtained from light, water flow, and human work, could be promising sources of energy for powering low-duty devices. To assess the feasibility of powering future RObjects with technologies, tests were conducted on commonly available robotic vacuum cleaners. These tests established an upper-bound on the power requirements for RObjects. Finally, based on these results, the feasibility of powering RObjects using scavenged energy is discussed. © 2011 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Robotic devices are increasingly penetrating the human work spaces as stand alone units and helpers. It is believed that a robot could be easily integrated with humans, if the robot can learn how to behave in a socially acceptable manner. This involves a robot to observe, learn and comply with basic rules of human behaviors. As an example, one would expect a robot to travel in an environment without intruding human workspaces unnecessarily. Thus, identifying common motion patterns of people by observing a specific environment is an important task as people's trajectories are usually not random, however are tailored to the way the environment is structured. We propose a learning algorithm to construct a Sampled Hidden Markov Model (SHMM) that captures behavior of people through observations and then demonstrate how this model could be exploited for planning socially aware paths. Experimental results are presented to demonstrate the viability of the proposed approach. ©2010 IEEE.

AB  - This paper presents our work on realizing the manipulation of nut and bolt for assembly work using dual arm manipulator. The robot architecture consists of multiple active sensors and control procedures that are structured to work for real time operations. It is specifically designed to be similar to human arm which has seven joints for each arm to perform complicated assembly tasks on small parts using both hands that usually requires high cost human labour. Sensors are optimally used to provide data of the environment and the target object in variable conditions, shapes and sizes. Data between eye-in-hand and eye-to-hand cameras are fused and handled together with force sensors and encoders to calculate the required robot dynamics of the seven link arms for object manipulation. The first experiment that has been used as the basic platform in preparing our robot for assembly task consists of autonomous picking and placing an M8 sized bolt and hexagonal nuts of minimum 2 mm radius. Besides, based on the proposed vision processing, the robot hand could self adjust its wrist angle to avoid collision between the fingers and objects during grasping. Moreover, we showed application of vision to align M10 bolt and nut for complicated screwing operation. Experiment results are laid out to show the robot performance for above operations thus producing a dexterous dual arm robot for assembly work purposes.

AB  - Mining data from online games provides a potential alternative to programming behavior and dialogue for characters in interactive narratives by hand. Human annotation of course-grained tasks can provide explanations that make the data more useful to an AI system, however human labor is expensive. We describe a semiautomatic methodology for recognizing tasks in gameplay traces, including an annotation tool for non-experts, and a runtime algorithm. Our results show that this methodology works well with a large corpus from one game, and suggests the possibility of refactoring the development process for interactive narratives. © 2010 ACM.

AB  - Although a remarkably high degree of automation has been reached in production and intra-logistics nowadays, human labor is still used for transportation using handcarts and forklifts. High labor cost and risk of injury are the undesirable consequences. Alternative approaches in automated warehouses are fixed installed conveyors installed either overhead or floor-based. The drawback of such solutions is the lack of flexibility, which is necessary when the production lines of the company change. Then, such an installation has to be re-built. In this paper, we propose a novel approach of decentralized teams of autonomous robots performing intra-logistics tasks using distributed algorithms. Centralized solutions suffer from limited scalability and have a single point of failure. The task is to transport material between stations keeping the communication network structure intact and most importantly, to facilitate a fair distribution of robots among loading stations. Our approach is motivated by strategies from peer-to-peer-networks and mobile ad-hoc networks. In particular we use an adapted version of distributed heterogeneous hash tables (DHHT) for distributing the tasks and localized communication. Experimental results presented in this paper show that our method reaches a fair distribution of robots over loading stations.

AB  - Some of the significant measures that need to be taken to deal with the challenges of adopting the artificial intelligence (AI) approach to computer science are discussed. Users of the AI approach need to remember that it is impossible to differentiate the actual achievement of AI from the degree from which people change when faced with intelligent technology. Users of AI approach need to remember that it creates significant economic challenges. Excessive dependence on the approach can also undermine human labor and creativity. This can lead to adverse impact on most of the successful design that have been invented for generating and preserving individual human dignity and freedom. The idea of creativity emerging from the AI approach has the potential to adversely affect the basic technological development.

AB  - How to mine massive datasets is a challenging problem with great potential value. Motivated by this challenge, much effort has concentrated on developing scalable versions of machine learning algorithms. However, the cost of mining large datasets is not just computational; preparing the datasets into the right form so that learning algorithms can be applied is usually costly, due to the human labor that is typically required and a large number of choices in data preparation, which include selecting different subsets of data and aggregating data at different granularities. We make the key observation that, for a number of practically motivated problems, these choices can be defined using database queries and analyzed in an automatic and systematic manner. Specifically, we propose a new class of data-mining problem, called bellwether analysis, in which the goal is to find a few query-defined predictors (e.g., first week sales of Peoria, IL of an item) that can be used to accurately predict the result of a target query (e.g., first year worldwide sales of the item) from a large number of queries that define candidate predictors. To make a prediction for a new item, the data needed to generate such predictors has to be collected (e.g., selling the new item in Peoria, IL for a week and collecting the sales data). A useful predictor is one that has high prediction accuracy and a low data-collection cost. We call such a cost-effective predictor a bellwether. This article introduces bellwether analysis, which integrates database query processing and predictive modeling into a single framework, and provides scalable algorithms for large datasets that cannot fit in main memory. Through a series of extensive experiments, we show that bellwethers do exist in real-world databases, and that our computation techniques achieve good efficiency on large datasets. © 2009 ACM.

AB  - In the situation in which a robot and a human work together by collaborating with each other, a robot and a human share one working environment, and each interferes in each other. In other ward, it is impossible to avoid the physical contact and the interaction of force between a robot and a human. The boundary of each complex dynamic occupation area changes in the connection movement which is the component of collaborative works at this time. The main restraint condition which relates to the robustness of that connection movement is each physical charactristics, that is, the embodiment. A robot body is variability though the embodiment of a human is almost fixed. Therefore, the safe and the robust connection movement is brought when a robot has the robot body which is well suitable for the embodiment of a human. A purpose for this research is that the colaboration works between the self-reconfiguration robot and a human is realized. To achieve this purpose, a self-reconfiguration algorithm based on some indexes to evaluate a robot body in the macroscopic point of view was examined on a modular robot system of the 2-D lattice structure. In this paper, it investigated effect specially that the object of learning of each individual was limited to the cooperative behavior between the adjoining modules toward the macroscopic evaluation index. © 2009 The Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan.

AB  - Searching and selecting articles to be included in systematic reviews is a real challenge for healthcare agencies responsible for publishing these reviews. The current practice of manually reviewing all papers returned by complex hand-crafted boolean queries is human labour-intensive and difficult to maintain. We demonstrate a two-stage searching system that takes advantage of ranked queries and support-vector machine text classification to assist in the retrieval of relevant articles, and to restrict results to higher-quality documents. Our proposed approach shows significant work saved in the systematic review process over a baseline of a keyword-based retrieval system.

AB  - For quick access to new handwritten collections, current handwriting recognition methods are too cumbersome. They cannot deal with the lack of labeled data and would require extensive laboratory training for each individual script, style, language and collection. We propose a biologically inspired whole-word recognition method which is used to incrementally elicit word labels in a live, web-based annotation system, named Monk. Since human labor should be minimized given the massive amount of image data, it becomes important to rely on robust perceptual mechanisms in the machine. Recent computational models of the neuro-physiology of vision are applied to isolated word classification. A primate cortex-like mechanism allows to classify text-images that have a low frequency of occurrence. Typically these images are the most difficult to retrieve and often contain named entities and are regarded as the most important to people. Usually standard pattern-recognition technology cannot deal with these text-images if there are not enough labeled instances. The results of this retrieval system are compared to normalized word-image matching and appear to be very promising. © 2008 IEEE.

AB  - We describe an acoustic chord transcription system that uses symbolic data to train hidden Markov models and gives best-of-class frame-level recognition results. We avoid the extremely laborious task of human annotation of chord names and boundaries-which must be done to provide machine learning models with ground truth-by performing automatic harmony analysis on symbolic music files. In parallel, we synthesize audio from the same symbolic files and extract acoustic feature vectors which are in perfect alignment with the labels. We, therefore, generate a large set of labeled training data with a minimal amount of human labor. This allows for richer models. Thus, we build 24 key-dependent HMMs, one for each key, using the key information derived from symbolic data. Each key model defines a unique state-transition characteristic and helps avoid confusions seen in the observation vector. Given acoustic input, we identify a musical key by choosing a key model with the maximum likelihood, and we obtain the chord sequence from the optimal state path of the corresponding key model, both of which are returned by a Viterbi decoder. This not only increases the chord recognition accuracy, but also gives key information. Experimental results show the models trained on synthesized data perform very well on real recordings, even though the labels automatically generated from symbolic data are not 100% accurate. We also demonstrate the robustness of the tonal centroid feature, which outperforms the conventional chroma feature. © 2008 IEEE.

AB  - Robots are an inevitable part of the future industry. Their increased utilization will result in increased productivity, safer work environment and very helpful in human daily life. However, their successful implementation will only happen if their use will only benefit and not harm the human. That is why it is crucial to take into consideration safety aspect in human robot interaction and robotization on the whole. In this paper has attempted to summarize the major areas of research currently under investigation in the development of safe and reliable robot systems and its interaction with environment. These areas include hazards investigation, the design robot itself, standards development for safety, methods of safeguarding, etc. This study is aimed at understanding common safety problems with robot installation in human working environment. The purpose of this paper is to draw upon the vast bank of research in robot safety and indicate how the existing results may be generated and applied to the field of Human-Robotic interaction. © 2007 IEEE.

AB  - Visual tracking is currently one of the most active research topics in computer vision. It has a broad range of applications and many visual-tracking Technologies are applied to the production auto-lines. In fact, the problem of visual tracking usually is regarded as the problem of combining control with computer vision. According to the result of image processing, production auto-lines can be monitored and operated automatically. The intelligent visual tracking system used on production auto-lines can take the place of inspector and decrease the amount of human labour needed. In this paper, we review the developments of visual tracking and present some methods of image processing and servo control related to visual tracking. © 2006 IEEE.

AB  - A new architecture for fusing information and data from heterogeneous sources is proposed. The approach takes criminalistics as a model. In analogy to the work of detectives, who investigate crimes, software agents are instantiated that pursue clues and try to consolidate or to dismiss hypotheses. Like their human pendants, they can, if questions beyond their competencies arise, consult expert agents. Within the context of a certain task, region, and time interval, specialized operations are applied to each relevant information source, e.g. IMINT, SIGINT, ACINT,..., HUMINT*, databases etc. in order to establish hit lists of first clues. Each clue is described by its pertinent facts, uncertainties, and dependencies in form of a local degree-of-belief (DoB) distribution† in a Bayesian sense. For each clue, an agent is instantiated which cooperates with other agents and experts. Expert agents support the use of different information sources. Consultation of experts capable of accessing certain information sources results in changes of the DoB of the pertinent clue. According to the significance of concentration of their DoB distribution, clues are abandoned or pursued further to formulate task specific hypotheses. Communication between the agents serves to find out whether different clues belong to the same cause and thus can be combined. At the end of the investigation process, the different hypotheses are evaluated by a jury and a final report is created that constitutes the fusion result. The approach proposed avoids calculating global DoB distributions by adopting a local Bayesian approximation and thus reduces the complexity of the problem essentially. Different information sources are transformed into DoB distributions using the maximum entropy paradigm and considering known facts as constraints. Nominal, ordinal, and cardinal quantities can be treated within this framework equally. The architecture is scalable by tailoring the number of agents according to the available computer resources, to the priority of tasks, and to the tolerable maximum duration of the fusion process. Furthermore, the architecture allows cooperative work of human and automated agents and experts, if not all subtasks can be accomplished automatically.

AB  - We have developed and tested an advanced EVA communications and computing system to increase astronaut self-reliance and safety, reducing dependence on continuous monitoring and advising from mission control on Earth. This system, called Mobile Agents (MA), is voice controlled and provides information verbally to the astronauts through programs called "personal agents." The system partly automates the role of CapCom in Apollo-including monitoring and managing EVA navigation, scheduling, equipment deployment, telemetry, health tracking, and scientific data collection. EVA data are stored automatically in a shared database in the habitat/vehicle and mirrored to a site accessible by a remote science team. The program has been developed iteratively in the context of use, including six years of ethnographic observation of field geology. Our approach is to develop automation that supports the human work practices, allowing people to do what they do well, and to work in ways they are most familiar. Field experiments in Utah have enabled empirically discovering requirements and testing alternative technologies and protocols. This paper reports on the 2004 system configuration, experiments, and results, in which an EVA robotic assistant (ERA) Followed geologists approximately 150 m through a winding, narrow canyon. On voice command, the ERA took photographs and panoramas and was directed to move and wait in various locations to serve as a relay on the wireless network. The MA system is applicable to many space work situations that involve creating and navigating from maps (including configuring equipment for local topology), interacting with piloted and unpiloted rovers, adapting to environmental conditions, and remote team collaboration involving people and robots.

AB  - In this paper, we propose a novel interaction model for a human-robot cooperative task. The CEA (Commands Embedded in Actions) model reduces a human work-load because a user of a robot needs less inputs and outputs than DCM (Direct Commanding methods) like gesturing. We propose ECEA (Extended CEA) in order to deal with more complicated tasks than CEA. On the cooperative sweeping task between a human and a mobile robot, we apply temporal extension as one of ECEA instances. Mmultiple commands are embedded in the human action by the extention and the robot performs more complicated task. The experiments for conforming reduction of a human work-load using ECEA are conduced on the sweeping task. Human cognitive loads are measured as human work-loads and compared between ECEA and DCM. The results of the experiments showed that the ECEA minimized a human cognitive load. © 2005 IEEE.

AB  - We work hard on creating AI-wings for physicians to let them fly higher and faster in diagnosing patients-A task that physicians do not want to automate. What we do not work hard on is determining the ENVIRONMENT in which physicians' AI wings are supposed to function. It seems to be a job for social/business analysts that have their own separate kingdom. For the sake of all of us (potential patients!) social/business consultants and their methodologies should not be treated as a separate kingdom. The most urgent task is to achieve synergy between (1) AI/Fuzzy/Neural research, (2) Applied medical AI, (3) Social/Business research on medical institutions. We need this synergy in order to assure humanistic medical technology; technology flexible and sensitive enough to facilitate healthcare work while leaving space for human pride and creativity. In order to achieve humanistic technology, designers should consider the impact of technological breakthroughs on the organizations in which this technology will function and the nature of work of humans destined to use this technology. Situated (different for each organization), Strategic (based on an in-depth knowledge of Healthcare business), and AI-Enhanced (ended with a dynamic model) method for introducing technology to Healthcare allows identifying areas where technology can make medical work easier. Using this method before automating human work will get us closer to the ideal where there is no discontinuity between design and use of programs; where the technology matches users' needs perfectly-the world with humanistic technology and healthcare workers with AI-wings. © 2005 Renata G.

AB  - Several centers of atomic and molecular data in the world maintain research databases for use in fusion plasma simulations, hadron therapy, modelling the universe and other areas. Among the data center activities, collection of experimental and theoretical results across the world has been of major importance. This includes the identification, relevance assessment and retrieval of journal articles, followed by the data extraction, data mining, format conversion and data input. The methodology of the process still largely relies on working groups of specialists and part-time human labor, in spite of recent modernization in journal publishing, especially the electronic journals newly available in subscription domain and the free-access online abstract databases. This work focuses on automating the above procedure to the maximum extent possible. In particular, we design a download robot that performs query search and abstract retrieval for the candidates of relevant articles over the internet at first stage, followed by fultext retrieval (pdf format), text extraction and a deterministic relevance judgement. As a demonstration, we have also developed a bibliography database for electron-molecule collisions that automatically updates its contents over the internet in regular time intervals. The present work belongs to the project for evolutional data collecting system supported by a JSPS project which involves several research institutes. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005.

AB  - In the last two decades, a wide range of robotic systems for interior construction tasks was being examined (mainly by research and development institutions around the world). A main parameter that differentiates between these systems is their level of autonomy. Reducing the level of autonomy of a given robotic system necessitates increasing auxiliary human work. The efficiency of the system as a whole (i.e., robot/s + operator/s + worker/s) must be examined in order to determine the proper balance between robots and human beings. This article presents the development of a methodology for evaluating a robotized construction task by examining and comparing various ways to share the work between robots and human operators and workers. The methodology is demonstrated by implementing it on two interior finishing tasks-block laying and wall painting. Testing these tasks included full-scale experiments. The detailed analyses of these two applications show the breakeven points of profitable robotic systems, depending on the combination of their own cost, the hourly cost of construction workers, and the expected hourly cost of construction-robot operators in a given labor market. The results lead to a better understanding of possible human-and-robot integration. In particular, this article provides researchers and developers of construction robotics with a systematic approach for evaluation and validation of various ideas prior to investing resources in actual prototypes. © 2004 Computer-Aided Civil and Infrastructure Engineering.

AB  - As a method structuring information and knowledge contained in texts, text categorization can be to a great extend automated. The automatic text classification systems implement machine learning algorithms and need training samples. In commercial applications however, the automatic categorization appear to come up against limiting factors. For example, it turns out to be difficult to reduce the sample complexity without the categorization quality in terms of recall and precision will suffer. Instead of trying to fully replace the human work by machine, it could be more effective and ultimately efficient to let human and machine cooperate. So we have developed a categorization workbench to realise synergy between manual and machine categorization. To compare the categorization workbench with common automatic classification systems, the automatic categorizer of the IBM DB2 Information Integrator for Content has been chosen for tests. The test results show that, benefiting from the incorporation of user's domain knowledge, the categorization workbench can improve the recall by a factor of two till four with the same number of training samples as the automatic categorizer uses. Further, to get a comparable categorization quality, the categorization workbench just needs an eighth till a quarter of the training samples as the automatic categorizer does. © 2004 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - At the Institute of Agricultural and Environmental Engineering (IMAG B.V.) an autonomous harvesting robot for cucumbers was developed and tested in a greenhouse in autumn 2001. Analysis of the harvest process had revealed that at a 2 ha Dutch production facility four robots are needed to replace the skilled human work force during the peak season. Then assuming a success rate of 100%, a harvest cycle might take at most 10 s per cucumber fruit. In this paper the results of the field test of the harvesting robot are reported and analysed in view of the performance criteria mentioned above. Cucumbers (Cucumis sativus cv. Korinda) were grown in a high-wire cultivation system. In four independent experiments the robot was tested. The average success rate was 74.4%. The majority of failures originated from inaccurate positioning of the end-effector at the stalk of the fruit. It was found to be a great advantage that the system was able to perform several harvest attempts on a single cucumber from different harvest positions of the robot. This improved the success rate considerably. A single successful harvest cycle took 65.2 s per cucumber. Since not all attempts were successful, a cycle time of 124 s per harvested cucumber was measured under practical circumstances. The test confirmed the ability to harvest more than one cucumber using a single set of images which reduced the cycle time of a successful harvest to 56.7 and 53.0 s if two or three cucumbers were harvested. To bridge the gap between the measured performance and the design specifications, future research focuses on improving the success rate, faster hardware and software for image processing and motion planning as well as the reduction of the motion time of the manipulator. © 2003 Silsoe Research Institute.

AB  - This study presents a method of human co-operating systems, which can determine when support behavior is necessary by a human work model. We focus on assembly work as the target and propose a self-organizing approach of human work models by sampled human information by vision sensors. The support is determined according to the work model. Such a system would realize provision of support without a strict model of the assembly target and enable support in cases where neither the assembly process, nor the final form of the completed task, is known to the system in advance. First, a method of measuring human information and extracting states where support is necessary, from the human work model is presented. Next, a support system for assembly work co-operation according to the work model, with physical interaction capabilities is described. Experiments were carried out to evaluate and verify the effectiveness of the system. The results show that the constructed assembly support system is effective in both improving performance and increasing friendliness.

AB  - Fertile soils are one of the most important resources on earth. Sustainable agriculture should use this resource in such a way that the present and future human needs for food or other agricultural goods are warranted whereas the quality of the environment and the natural resources remain preserved. Plant production needs resources of different origins and most of them are maintained according to certain soil parameters. But as soils are neither static, nor homogenous in space and time, the standard approach of uniform application rates always results in a side by side of over and under supply. Precision Agriculture aims at addressing this spatial variability but for this task physico-chemical images [Digital Agro Resource Maps (DARM)] of the land are required. Efforts in acquiring these maps are actually one of the major bottlenecks for the exploitation of Precision Agriculture at the farm level. Most recent developments in strategies for reducing sampling efforts without loosing information are in 'self surveying'. This is a method by which basic spatial information of soil texture, organic matter content and geomorphology for instance are gathered just by human skills and 'directed', or, 'smart' sampling which uses already existing spatial information of a site to guide sampling to representative plots. Optical sensors for major important soil information like soil texture and plant available nutrients are far away from being realized. Already existing approaches for on-the-go measurements of soil features are still soil invasive and therefore slow and ineffective as far as human labor is concerned. However, these methods might benefit a lot from developments in robot techniques. Remote sensing is a promising method for gathering spatial information of soils, but will always need a certain amount of work on the ground to allow interpretation and calibration of images. In so far it fits well with the strategy of 'directed' sampling. Temporal availability and visibility are major problems for remote sensing which might be solved by new technological approaches like unmanned air vehicles (UAV) or stationary 'surf-eyes'. New approaches are also required for the interpretation of spatially distributed soil and plant analysis data and how fertilizer recommendations are derived to be from this information. It is obvious from the first experiences with Precision Agriculture under practical farming conditions that the standard approach of fertilizer recommendation does not provide the best basis in the sense of sustainable farming for a successful implementation of Precision Agriculture.

AB  - Recovery of a three-dimensional (3-D) description of the world from images has been a central topic in computer vision from the early days of AI research and is currently becoming of great importance, particularly to the film and entertainment industries. In particular, this article addresses the problems of preproduction and postproduction for 3-D compositing of graphics in film and of building multimedia content for computer entertainment systems, both areas of burgeoning activity currently driven extensively with expensive skilled human labor. In this article, we discuss how the particular requirements for accuracy and generality of these applications impact the choices of vision techniques and how the interactive nature of production systems can be exploited to bypass the difficulties of segmentation and scene understanding that has prevented equally successful systems from arising in traditional AI contexts. We show actual results of both preproduction and postproduction processes in film and multimedia production, including preproduction model building, postproduction alignment of 3-D mattes into film, and a combination of preproduction and postproduction for inserting 3-D graphics into a video scene. The article concludes with a discussion of how the technology can be profitably merged with existing production practices and how it can be extended to provide further capabilities in production of entertainment media. © 1997 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The objective of these studies was to develop a multipurpose intelligent robot for vegetable production. Many of the vegetable-producing operations are presently performed by human labor, because they need to be carried out selectively. In this study, the robot which consisted mainly of a rectangular manipulator, a traveling device and computer (80286 CPU) was constructed on an experimental basis. The outline of the robot and its application to transplanting, weed control and harvesting for several leafy vegetables in the hill space are reported. Two types of transplanting and harvesting hands were tested. Weed location was determined by processing color images, and the weeds were removed with a blade constructed experimentally. As a result, it was shown that 1) cabbage and spinach seedlings could be transplanted with a hand constructed on an experimental basis, 2) weeds could be accurately determined and 3) leafy vegetables like spinach could be harvested with the hand with reciprocating knives.

AB  - Improvement in human reliability is of great concern in modern high technology systems. Efforts in the nuclear industry, mostly in Japan were surveyed and classified into improvement in human work situations and that in man-machine systems. In the former, human error prone situations were investigated using training simulators and from actual near-misses and incidents in real operating plants. The results have been used to improve operator training and other work situations. The objective of man-machine system improvement is to optimize the total performance of nuclear power plants such that automation and supervisory control by human operators will be designed to reduce human errors as well as to effectively utilize human ingenuity. Computerized operator support systems were surveyed based on the operators' role in plant operational safety. The main support functions considered here are a kind of computerization of operation manuals revised after the Three Mile Island-2 accident, and mainly supports the operators' rule-based behavior. The development of intelligent man-machine systems was then aimed at to support operators in their knowledge-based behavior to cope with unforeseen abnormal events, considering the recent advance in artificial intelligence and cognitive engineering. A case study is described.

AB  - The vision of the new generation of office systems is based on the hypothesis that an automatic support system is all the more useful and acceptable, the more systems behaviour and performance are in accordance with features of human behaviour. Consequently recent development activities are influenced by the paradigm of the computer as man's "cooperative assistant". The metaphors of assistance and cooperation illustrate some major requirements to be met by new office systems. Cooperative office systems will raise a set of new questions about the future of human work, human-machine interaction, the forms of individual control of work, the scope of action and the development of competence in the frame of AI-supported cooperative work, the relative benefits of different types of organizations, etc. With increasing autonomy of the computer in task accomplishment, research should also be concerned with the question of the limits of such a development. In AI-research and development there is much discussion of the intended performance of that new technology. Perhaps this will provide insights into, how these new machines should support numerous aspects of individual or cooperative work. But we find fewer ideas about the future of human work. What will the role of the human actor be in future AI-supported cooperative work? What kind of work do we want to support with AI-machines? In the following article I will try to identify some questions for further sociological research activities. I will base my considerations on some theoretical aspects of understanding and meaning. Regarding identical and non-identical aspects in communication behaviour of human and machines, I will focus on some questions to be investigated. Finally some methodological problems of sociological research in the field of Artificial Intelligence will be discussed, especially the so-called "Time-Dilemma" of sociological research in technology. © 1991 Springer-Verlag London Limited.

AB  - Automation is commonly considered for application in manufacturing industry as a means of increasing productivity on repetitive assembly tasks. Attempts to automate production processes fully have been hindered by the relatively slow development of suitable technology that is cost-effective in comparison with human labour. It is known that automation is successful for high volume, rigidly structured tasks that require little decision-making. It is not so successful in the less structured tasks where human decision-making plays an important role. It is in manufacturing scenarios that rely on human decision-making that people with impaired motor function may use appropriate handling devices to carry out limited manual tasks within a more complex job activity. Demographic changes are resulting in an ageing population, a shrinking labour force and, as a result, a need for industry to consider alternative sources of labour. Most previous attempts to use robots in vocational rehabilitation have been made on an individual basis where a person possessing a desired skill becomes disabled and is able to continue in the job with robot assistance. Since many people with severe physical disability from birth have a restricted primary and secondary education, it is unlikely that there will be widespread prospects in jobs such as computer programming or accounting. This is not to say that computer-oriented jobs are not ideal for some disabled people, particularly those who have attained a high level of job qualification prior to becoming disabled. The research described in this paper, however, aims to identify generic job activities that require human decision-making ability and that have a minimum of prerequisite educational qualifications. This scenario is typical of many of the jobs within the manufacturing sector that allow the worker to acquire the necessary job skills through on-the-job training.

AB  - The Singer Company, Kearfott Division, a long time leading developer of inertial quality sensors, has demonstrated innovative design experience and manufacturing capabilities while placing ever increasing emphasis on achieving design-to-cost objectives. This has become more difficult, however, where the use of conventional design approaches has been maintained. These features continue to be carried over from previously developed instruments which were proven successful with respect to performance, life and reliability. In most cases, they evolved as a result of using state-of-the-art assembly techniques where the dexterity of hands-on human labor is of prime consideration. Consequently, the designs of various hardware items and sophisticated instruments are configured to achieve ease of manual assembly operations, resulting in the use of costly labor-intensive techniques to achieve a final assembled part.

AB  - Almost everyone would like a robot to do their work, that is, until the robot takes over the job and the pay check disappears. The thought of replacing human labor with robots and causing widespread unemployment is not new. Many studies have been made concerning the social impact of robots on the workforce. This fear of unemployment is great enough to cause resistance to robot installations by the workforce in the United States. Therefore, one of the most important tasks of robot installation is overcoming worker resistance. The fear of worker replacement and resultant unemployment must be addressed to assure successful installations.
